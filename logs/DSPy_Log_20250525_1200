    instructions='You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.\nYour goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:\n1.  **background**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper\'s core work.\n    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Giriş\' (Introduction), \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work), \'Genel Bilgiler\' (General Information).\n    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.\n\n2.  **basis**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Yöntem\' (Methodology), \'Materyal ve Metot\' (Material and Method), \'Model Tasarımı\' (Model Design), \'Veri Seti\' (Dataset), \'Uygulama\' (Implementation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The current study\'s methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.\n\n3.  **discuss**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work\'s importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Bulgular ve Tartışma\' (Results and Discussion), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.\n\n4.  **support**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Doğrulama\' (Validation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study\'s findings by demonstrating consistency.\n\n5.  **differ**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study\'s findings.\n\n6.  **other**:\n    * **Description**: The citation\'s rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don\'t fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).\n    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.\n    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.\n\n**Important Considerations for Classification**:\n* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.\n* **Context is Key**: While the \'section\' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the \'citation\' text itself. A citation\'s intent might occasionally differ from its section\'s typical use.\n* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.\n\n**Input Format**:\nEach citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:\n* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).\n* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).\n* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).\n\nAll citations will be presented as a JSON array.\nExample of Input Data Structure:\n[\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_1",\n    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",\n    "section": "Giriş"\n  },\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_2",\n    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark.

Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.\nExample of Output Data Structure:\n[\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_1",\n    "intent": "background"\n  },\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_2",\n    "intent": "basis"\n  }\n]\n\nPlease return your response strictly as a valid JSON array.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. It specifically targets citations in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence. The classification task involves categorizing each citation into one of six predefined categories: background, basis, discuss, support, differ, or other. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science citation classification schema and have been refined for clarity.

The program operates by analyzing the citation text and the section title in which the citation appears, both of which are provided in Turkish. The classification is based on the semantic content and rhetorical function of the citation, with the section title providing contextual clues. However, the primary basis for classification is the citation's semantic content.

The process is a zero-shot classification task, meaning it does not rely on pre-defined examples for learning. Instead, it uses a pre-defined set of instructions and guidelines to classify the citations. The input is a JSON array of citation objects, each containing an id, citation text, and section title. The output is a JSON array of objects with each citation's id and its classified intent.

The program uses a class `ClassifyCitation` that initializes a classifier with a signature `CitationIntentSignature`. The classifier processes the citation and section input to predict the rhetorical intent, returning a structured JSON output without additional commentary or explanation. This approach ensures a systematic and consistent classification of citations based on their rhetorical roles in academic papers.

Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module is responsible for processing each citation and its corresponding section title to determine the rhetorical intent of the citation. This module leverages the `ClassifyCitation` class, which utilizes a chain-of-thought approach to analyze the semantic content and context provided by the section title. The module outputs a reasoning field that provides a step-by-step justification for the classification decision, and an intent field that indicates the specific category into which the citation falls. This functionality is crucial for the program's objective of systematically and accurately classifying citations based on their rhetorical roles in academic papers.

    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated.

    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers into specific rhetorical intent categories. The task involves analyzing citations and their corresponding section titles, both provided in Turkish, to determine the role each citation plays in the context of the research paper. The program uses a classification schema inspired by the Web of Science citation classification, refined to include categories like "background," "basis," "discuss," "support," "differ," and "other."

The process begins by taking input in the form of JSON objects, each containing a citation and its section title. The program then applies a language model, structured as a chain of thought, to classify each citation based on its content and the context provided by the section title. The classification involves reasoning through the citation's content to determine its rhetorical function, such as whether it provides foundational context ("background"), is central to the methodology ("basis"), or plays another role.

The output is a JSON array of objects, each containing the citation's unique identifier and its classified intent, ensuring a clear understanding of how each citation contributes to the research paper. The program is particularly tailored for zero-shot classification, meaning it does not rely on pre-defined examples but rather on the semantic understanding of the citation and section content in Turkish.

Section: VERİ SETİ VE BULGULAR (DATA SET AND FINDINGS)
Reasoning: The citation provides a formula for calculating the mean absolute error, which is a specific method or metric used in the study. The section "VERİ SETİ VE BULGULAR" suggests that this is part of the findings or results, but the citation itself is about a methodological aspect. The citation indicates that the study is using a specific formula from the cited work, which aligns with the "basis" category, as it directly reports using a method described in the cited work.

Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: The citation discusses the advantages of technology applications in AI-based rehabilitation, such as customization to individual needs, flexible treatment parameters, reliable data collection, real-time feedback, and reducing burnout. These points are presented as general benefits of AI-based rehabilitation technology, without indicating that the current study directly builds upon or uses these specific technologies or methods. The section title "Yapay Zekâ Temelli Akıllı Rehabilitasyon Teknikleri" suggests a focus on techniques, but the citation itself provides a broad overview of advantages rather than specific methodological details or foundational work for the current study.

Section: Giriş
Reasoning: The citation lists various analytical and optimization methods, such as nonlinear inverse solution methods, metaheuristic approaches, Fourier, Hilbert, and wavelet analyses, tomographic approaches, artificial neural networks, and Euler deconvolution. These methods are mentioned in the "Giriş" (Introduction) section, which typically provides background information. The citation does not indicate that these methods are directly used or adapted in the current study, nor does it engage in a detailed discussion or comparison of results. Therefore, the citation serves to provide a broader context and acknowledge foundational knowledge relevant to the field.

You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",

    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"

You are tasked with a specialized role as an academic editor focusing on Turkish scholarly articles in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence. Your objective is to thoroughly examine and categorize academic citations within these Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. Each citation, along with its section title, will be provided in Turkish.

Your mission is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories, which have been adapted from the Web of Science citation classification schema and refined for clarity:

1. **background**: Citations that provide general context, historical information, or acknowledge foundational studies not directly built upon by the current research. These citations are typically found in sections like 'Giriş' (Introduction) or 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review).

2. **basis**: Citations that serve as a fundamental pillar for the current study, where specific methods, algorithms, datasets, or equipment from the cited work are directly used or adapted. These are often located in sections such as 'Yöntem' (Methodology) or 'Veri Seti' (Dataset).

3. **discuss**: Citations actively analyzed or critically evaluated within the study, often involving a detailed examination of arguments, findings, or theories. These are common in 'Tartışma' (Discussion) or 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review).

4. **support**: Citations that reinforce or validate the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency with the cited work's results. Look for these in 'Bulgular' (Results) or 'Sonuçlar' (Conclusions).

5. **differ**: Citations that highlight contrasting or differing results compared to the current study, offering alternative views. These typically appear in 'Bulgular' (Results) or 'Tartışma' (Discussion).

6. **other**: Citations that cannot be confidently classified into the above categories due to insufficient information or lack of clear rhetorical intent.

**Key Considerations**:
- The text and section titles will be in Turkish, and your classification should be based on understanding this content.
- The section title provides context but focus primarily on the citation's semantic content and rhetorical function.
- This is a zero-shot classification task; rely on semantic understanding rather than pre-defined examples.

**Input Format**:
Citations are provided as JSON objects with fields for `id`, `citation`, and `section`, all in Turkish.

**Output Format**:
Return a JSON array of objects, each with the citation's `id` and its classified `intent`. Ensure the response is a valid JSON array without additional commentary.

Example Input:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. It is particularly focused on citations within the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence. The program uses a language model to analyze the citation text and the section title in which the citation appears to determine the citation's intent. It classifies each citation into one of six categories: "background," "basis," "discuss," "support," "differ," or "other." These categories are based on a refined version of the Web of Science citation classification schema. The classification process is zero-shot, meaning it does not rely on pre-defined examples for learning but instead uses the semantic content of the citation and its context within the paper. The output is a JSON array with each citation's ID and its classified intent.
task_demos Citation: Yapay zekâ temelli rehabilitasyonda teknoloji uygulamalarının avantajları; bireyin seviyesine ve yeteneklerine uygun dizayn edilebilir olması, terapist ve hasta için tedavinin süre, yoğunluk, zorluk, hız gibi parametrelerinin esnek olarak yapılandırılmasının sağlanması, güvenilir ve geçerli kullanıcı algılama donanımı ile objektif veri sağlaması, gerçek zamanlı geribildirim sağlanması, gerçek yaşam simülasyonu ile aktivite eğitim kolaylığı sunması ve rehabilitasyonun sürecinde hasta ve terapistin olası tükenmişliğini azaltmasıdır (Tarakçı, 2021) .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: The citation discusses the advantages of technology applications in AI-based rehabilitation, such as customization to individual needs, flexible treatment parameters, reliable data collection, real-time feedback, and reducing burnout. These points are presented as general benefits of AI-based rehabilitation technology, without indicating that the current study directly builds upon or uses these specific technologies or methods. The section title "Yapay Zekâ Temelli Akıllı Rehabilitasyon Teknikleri" suggests a focus on techniques, but the citation itself provides a broad overview of advantages rather than specific methodological details or foundational work for the current study.
Intent: background

Citation: Bunların başında doğrusal olmayan ters çözüm yöntemleri ve metasezgisel yaklaşımlar gibi optimizasyon yöntemleri olmak üzere  , Fourier, Hilbert ve dalgacık analizleri  , tomografik yaklaşımlar  , yapay sinir ağları 28] , ve Euler dekonvolüsyonu   gibi analitik yöntemler sayılabilir.
Section: Giriş
Reasoning: The citation lists various analytical and optimization methods, such as nonlinear inverse solution methods, metaheuristic approaches, Fourier, Hilbert, and wavelet analyses, tomographic approaches, artificial neural networks, and Euler deconvolution. These methods are mentioned in the "Giriş" (Introduction) section, which typically provides background information. The citation does not indicate that these methods are directly used or adapted in the current study, nor does it engage in a detailed discussion or comparison of results. Therefore, the citation serves to provide a broader context and acknowledge foundational knowledge relevant to the field.
Intent: background

Citation: ancak Zerocoin gibi sıfır bilgi protokolü içermediğinden mixin (halkadaki imza) sayısına bağlı olarak takip edilme olasılığı daha yüksektir Wijaya et al., 2018) .
Section: Karşılaştırma
Reasoning: The citation discusses a comparison between a protocol that does not include a zero-knowledge protocol like Zerocoin and its implications on traceability based on the number of mixins. The section title "Karşılaştırma" (Comparison) suggests that the citation is used to highlight differences or contrasts. The citation specifically points out a higher likelihood of traceability, which implies a difference in outcomes or characteristics compared to Zerocoin. This aligns with the intent of highlighting differences.
Intent: differ


2025/05/25 13:06:43 INFO dspy.teleprompt.mipro_optimizer_v2: Proposed Instructions for Predictor 0:

2025/05/25 13:06:43 INFO dspy.teleprompt.mipro_optimizer_v2: 0: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

[[ ## program_description ## ]]
This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. It is particularly focused on citations within the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence. The program uses a language model to analyze the citation text and the section title in which the citation appears to determine the citation's intent. It classifies each citation into one of six categories: "background," "basis," "discuss," "support," "differ," or "other." These categories are based on a refined version of the Web of Science citation classification schema. The classification process is zero-shot, meaning it does not rely on pre-defined examples for learning but instead uses the semantic content of the citation and its context within the paper. The output is a JSON array with each citation's ID and its classified intent.

Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module is responsible for taking a citation and its corresponding section title as inputs and producing a classification of the citation's rhetorical intent along with a reasoning for this classification. This module utilizes a language model to analyze the semantic content of the citation and the context provided by the section title. It applies a zero-shot classification approach to assign one of the predefined intent categories ("background," "basis," "discuss," "support," "differ," or "other") to each citation. The reasoning output provides a step-by-step justification for the classification decision, ensuring that users understand the basis of the intent categorization.

[[ ## task_demos ## ]]
Citation: Yapay zekâ temelli rehabilitasyonda teknoloji uygulamalarının avantajları; bireyin seviyesine ve yeteneklerine uygun dizayn edilebilir olması, terapist ve hasta için tedavinin süre, yoğunluk, zorluk, hız gibi parametrelerinin esnek olarak yapılandırılmasının sağlanması, güvenilir ve geçerli kullanıcı algılama donanımı ile objektif veri sağlaması, gerçek zamanlı geribildirim sağlanması, gerçek yaşam simülasyonu ile aktivite eğitim kolaylığı sunması ve rehabilitasyonun sürecinde hasta ve terapistin olası tükenmişliğini azaltmasıdır (Tarakçı, 2021) .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: The citation discusses the advantages of technology applications in AI-based rehabilitation, such as customization to individual needs, flexible treatment parameters, reliable data collection, real-time feedback, and reducing burnout. These points are presented as general benefits of AI-based rehabilitation technology, without indicating that the current study directly builds upon or uses these specific technologies or methods. The section title "Yapay Zekâ Temelli Akıllı Rehabilitasyon Teknikleri" suggests a focus on techniques, but the citation itself provides a broad overview of advantages rather than specific methodological details or foundational work for the current study.
Intent: background

Citation: Bunların başında doğrusal olmayan ters çözüm yöntemleri ve metasezgisel yaklaşımlar gibi optimizasyon yöntemleri olmak üzere  , Fourier, Hilbert ve dalgacık analizleri  , tomografik yaklaşımlar  , yapay sinir ağları 28] , ve Euler dekonvolüsyonu   gibi analitik yöntemler sayılabilir.
Section: Giriş
Reasoning: The citation lists various analytical and optimization methods, such as nonlinear inverse solution methods, metaheuristic approaches, Fourier, Hilbert, and wavelet analyses, tomographic approaches, artificial neural networks, and Euler deconvolution. These methods are mentioned in the "Giriş" (Introduction) section, which typically provides background information. The citation does not indicate that these methods are directly used or adapted in the current study, nor does it engage in a detailed discussion or comparison of results. Therefore, the citation serves to provide a broader context and acknowledge foundational knowledge relevant to the field.
Intent: background

Citation: ancak Zerocoin gibi sıfır bilgi protokolü içermediğinden mixin (halkadaki imza) sayısına bağlı olarak takip edilme olasılığı daha yüksektir Wijaya et al., 2018) .
Section: Karşılaştırma
Reasoning: The citation discusses a comparison between a protocol that does not include a zero-knowledge protocol like Zerocoin and its implications on traceability based on the number of mixins. The section title "Karşılaştırma" (Comparison) suggests that the citation is used to highlight differences or contrasts. The citation specifically points out a higher likelihood of traceability, which implies a difference in outcomes or characteristics compared to Zerocoin. This aligns with the intent of highlighting differences.
Intent: differ



[[ ## basic_instruction ## ]]
You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## proposed_instruction ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.

Predictor 0
i: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

i: You are tasked with a specialized role as an academic editor focusing on Turkish scholarly articles in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence. Your objective is to thoroughly examine and categorize academic citations within these Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. Each citation, along with its section title, will be provided in Turkish.

Your mission is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories, which have been adapted from the Web of Science citation classification schema and refined for clarity:

1. **background**: Citations that provide general context, historical information, or acknowledge foundational studies not directly built upon by the current research. These citations are typically found in sections like 'Giriş' (Introduction) or 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review).

2. **basis**: Citations that serve as a fundamental pillar for the current study, where specific methods, algorithms, datasets, or equipment from the cited work are directly used or adapted. These are often located in sections such as 'Yöntem' (Methodology) or 'Veri Seti' (Dataset).

3. **discuss**: Citations actively analyzed or critically evaluated within the study, often involving a detailed examination of arguments, findings, or theories. These are common in 'Tartışma' (Discussion) or 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review).

4. **support**: Citations that reinforce or validate the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency with the cited work's results. Look for these in 'Bulgular' (Results) or 'Sonuçlar' (Conclusions).

5. **differ**: Citations that highlight contrasting or differing results compared to the current study, offering alternative views. These typically appear in 'Bulgular' (Results) or 'Tartışma' (Discussion).

6. **other**: Citations that cannot be confidently classified into the above categories due to insufficient information or lack of clear rhetorical intent.

**Key Considerations**:
- The text and section titles will be in Turkish, and your classification should be based on understanding this content.
- The section title provides context but focus primarily on the citation's semantic content and rhetorical function.
- This is a zero-shot classification task; rely on semantic understanding rather than pre-defined examples.

**Input Format**:
Citations are provided as JSON objects with fields for `id`, `citation`, and `section`, all in Turkish.

**Output Format**:
Return a JSON array of objects, each with the citation's `id` and its classified `intent`. Ensure the response is a valid JSON array without additional commentary.

Example Input:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

Example Output:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please ensure your output is strictly formatted as a valid JSON array.

    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

Sadece Talimatlar (Instructions):
You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated.

    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.

    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:

The section title "Karşılaştırma" (Comparison) suggests that the citation is used to highlight differences or contrasts. The citation specifically points out a higher likelihood of traceability, which implies a difference in outcomes or characteristics compared to Zerocoin. This aligns with the intent of highlighting differences.

            * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.
        
        6.  **other**:
            * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
            * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
            * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.
        
        **Important Considerations for Classification**:
        * **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
        * **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
        * **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.
        
        **Input Format**:
        Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
        * `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
        * `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
        * `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).
        
        All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
        Example of Input Data Structure:
        [
          {
            "id": "unique_id_1",
            "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
            "section": "Giriş"
          },
          {
            "id": "unique_id_2",
            "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
            "section": "Yöntem"
          }
        ]
        
        **Expected Output Format**:
        The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
        Example of Output Data Structure:
        [
          {
            "id": "unique_id_1",
            "intent": "background"
          },
          {
            "id": "unique_id_2",
            "intent": "basis"
          }
        ]
        
        Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

Karşılaştırma


Assistant message:

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The citation discusses a comparison between a protocol that does not include a zero-knowledge protocol like Zerocoin and its implications on traceability based on the number of mixins. The section title "Karşılaştırma" (Comparison) suggests that the citation is used to highlight differences or contrasts. The citation specifically points out a higher likelihood of traceability, which implies a difference in outcomes or characteristics compared to Zerocoin. This aligns with the intent of highlighting differences.
