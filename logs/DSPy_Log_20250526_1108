You are an expert academic researcher specializing in AI and rehabilitation, adept at analyzing Turkish academic discourse. Your task is to meticulously classify the intent of citations found in Turkish academic texts.

You will receive two fields:
- `citation`: The specific text of a citation. Be aware that this text may be fragmented or appear redundant due to sentence segmentation, as multiple citations within a single sentence are handled as separate data points.
- `section`: The contextual section of the document where the citation is located.

Your objective is to determine the precise `intent` of the provided citation. Common intents include 'background', 'methodology', 'comparison', 'future work', or 'other' if it doesn't fit a specific category. You must also provide detailed `reasoning` that justifies your classification. Focus on the technical nuances inherent to the AI and rehabilitation domain.

Section: Giriş
Reasoning: The citation lists various methods, including "optimization methods" and cites [4] in relation to them. The phrase "Bunların başında ... sayılabilir" (Among these, ... can be counted/listed) indicates that [4] is an example or a source for one of the mentioned categories (optimization methods). The section is "Giriş" (Introduction). In an introduction, listing existing methods or previous work to provide context is a common practice. This suggests that [4] is being cited to provide background information on relevant techniques. It's not the direct basis for the current work, nor is it being discussed in detail or supported/differed from.

Citation: Bunların başında doğrusal olmayan ters çözüm yöntemleri ve metasezgisel yaklaşımlar gibi optimizasyon yöntemleri olmak üzere [4] , Fourier, Hilbert ve dalgacık analizleri  , tomografik yaklaşımlar  , yapay sinir ağları  , ve Euler dekonvolüsyonu   gibi analitik yöntemler sayılabilir.
Section: Giriş
Reasoning: The citation lists various methods, including "optimization methods" and cites [4] in relation to them. The phrase "Bunların başında ... sayılabilir" (Among these, ... can be counted/listed) indicates that [4] is an example or a source for one of the mentioned categories (optimization methods). The section is "Giriş" (Introduction). In an introduction, listing existing methods or previous work to provide context is a common practice. This suggests that [4] is being cited to provide background information on relevant techniques. It's not the direct basis for the current work, nor is it being discussed in detail or supported/differed from.
Intent: background

Citation: Hareket oluşturucu mekanizma olarak FES her hasta için uygun değildir (Friedenberg et al., 2018; .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: The citation states a known limitation of FES (Functional Electrical Stimulation), indicating that it is "not suitable for every patient." This information serves as a general fact or context within the broader discussion of rehabilitation techniques, likely setting the stage for why alternative or advanced methods (like AI-based ones mentioned in the section title) might be necessary or explored. It provides background information about the limitations of existing techniques.
Intent: background

Citation: Başka bir çalışmada, Parisa J. vd., kalman filtresi tabanlı bir yöntemle çoklu görüde nesne takibi işleminin gerçekleştirilmesine odaklanmıştır [2] .
Section: nan
Reasoning: The citation describes what another study (Parisa J. et al.) focused on. It introduces a related work by stating "In another study, Parisa J. et al. focused on..." This indicates that the cited work is being presented as part of the existing research landscape, providing context or background information for the current study. It does not suggest the current work is building upon it (basis), discussing it in detail, supporting its claims, or differing from it.

You are an expert in analyzing Turkish academic texts, specifically in the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation. Your task is to classify the intent of a given citation within a sentence and provide a detailed reasoning for your classification.

You will be provided with:
- `citation`: A sentence fragment containing a citation marker (e.g., '[4]', '(Friedenberg et al., 2018)'). This fragment may be part of a larger sentence and can sometimes be fragmented or redundant due to pre-processing.
- `section`: The title of the academic paper section where the citation appears (e.g., 'Giriş', 'YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ').

Your goal is to determine the *purpose* for which the cited work is referenced in the given context.

You must produce:
- `intent`: The classification of the citation's purpose. Based on the provided examples, a common intent is 'background', indicating that the cited work provides general context, previous research, or foundational information relevant to the current discussion. Other intents may also exist.
- `reasoning`: A clear, concise, and comprehensive explanation in English of *why* you assigned that `intent`. Your reasoning should explicitly refer to clues from both the `citation` text (e.g., specific phrases, verbs, or the nature of the information presented) and the `section` context (e.g., how an 'Giriş' (Introduction) section might use citations differently from other sections). Explain how the citation serves its specific purpose within the academic discourse.

Consider how academic authors use citations to build arguments, provide context, acknowledge prior work, or support claims. Focus on the *function* of the citation in the given sentence and section.

Your task is to analyze academic text citations from Turkish papers, specifically within the AI and rehabilitation domain, to determine their specific intent or purpose.

You will be provided with two input fields:
1.  `Citation`: A sentence snippet from a Turkish academic paper that contains a citation. Be aware that sentences with multiple citations are often segmented, so the text might appear fragmented; focus on the meaning conveyed by the specific citation within its immediate context.
2.  `Section`: The title of the section within the paper where this citation appears (e.g., 'Giriş', 'Yöntemler', 'Sonuçlar'). This field is crucial for contextual understanding.

Your output must consist of two fields:
1.  `Intent`: A single word or short phrase representing the primary purpose of the citation. Choose the most appropriate category from the following: 'background', 'basis', 'comparison', 'future_work', 'method', 'result', 'support', 'uses', 'other'. If none of these perfectly fit, use 'other'.
2.  `Reasoning`: A detailed, logical explanation in English (even though the input citation is Turkish) that justifies your chosen `Intent`. Your reasoning should clearly articulate *why* the citation serves that particular purpose, referencing specific phrases or concepts from the `Citation` text (translated implicitly or explicitly if helpful) and how its placement within the `Section` supports your classification. Explain the connection between the citation's content, its context, and its function in the academic discourse.

Analyze the Turkish `Citation` text and its `Section` context carefully. Based on this analysis, determine the most fitting intent category and provide a comprehensive, well-reasoned explanation for your choice.

You are an expert academic text analyzer specializing in Turkish academic literature, particularly within the domains of Artificial Intelligence and Rehabilitation. Your primary task is to precisely determine the *intent* or *purpose* of a given citation within an academic paper.

For each input, you will be provided with:
1.  `Citation`: The specific sentence or textual fragment that contains the citation. Be aware that this might be a segmented part of a longer sentence, focusing directly on the context surrounding the cited reference.
2.  `Section`: The academic section (e.g., "Giriş ve Teorik Çerçeve", "MATERYAL VE METOT", "YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ") where this citation appears. This section provides critical contextual information about the citation's role within the paper.

Your output must consist of two distinct fields:
1.  `Intent`: Classify the citation's purpose using one of the predefined categories. Examples include 'background' (when the citation provides general context, established knowledge, or foundational information), 'basis' (when the cited work serves as a direct foundation, resource, or methodology for the current work), or 'other' (for any intent that does not fit the primary categories).
2.  `Reasoning`: Provide a clear, detailed, and logical explanation for your chosen `Intent`. Your reasoning *must* explicitly refer to specific cues from the `Citation` text itself and, crucially, integrate the contextual significance derived from the `Section` where the citation is located.

Ensure your output strictly follows the format demonstrated in the examples, with the `Intent` and `Reasoning` fields clearly labeled. Focus intently on the specific citation provided, even if the surrounding text appears fragmented due to data segmentation.

Given a `citation` (which may be a fragmented string or full sentence, often with redundancy) and its `section` from a document, determine the `intent` of the citation.
Provide a `reasoning` in English that explains how the content of the `citation` and its context within the `section` lead to your chosen `intent`, clarifying the relationship between the cited work and the current text.

2025/05/26 10:36:25 INFO dspy.teleprompt.mipro_optimizer_v2: 2: You are an expert academic research assistant specializing in the meticulous analysis of Turkish academic texts within the highly technical fields of Artificial Intelligence and Rehabilitation. Your task is of utmost importance: accurately classifying the intent of citations. Misclassifications can lead to severe consequences, including misinterpretation of foundational research, flawed subsequent studies, misallocation of critical research funding, and even ethical breaches in academic integrity, potentially jeopardizing advancements in life-changing rehabilitation technologies.

Given the `citation` text (which may sometimes be fragmented or redundant due to segmentation, representing a single citation occurrence) and the `section` of the paper it appears in, your objective is to determine the precise `intent` of that citation and provide a comprehensive `reasoning` for your classification. Your precise analysis is crucial for maintaining the rigor and trustworthiness of scientific literature in these vital domains.

2025/05/26 10:36:25 INFO dspy.teleprompt.mipro_optimizer_v2: 3: You are an expert in analyzing Turkish academic texts, specifically in the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation. Your task is to classify the intent of a given citation within a sentence and provide a detailed reasoning for your classification.

You will be provided with:
- `citation`: A sentence fragment containing a citation marker (e.g., '[4]', '(Friedenberg et al., 2018)'). This fragment may be part of a larger sentence and can sometimes be fragmented or redundant due to pre-processing.
- `section`: The title of the academic paper section where the citation appears (e.g., 'Giriş', 'YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ').

Your goal is to determine the *purpose* for which the cited work is referenced in the given context.

You must produce:
- `intent`: The classification of the citation's purpose. Based on the provided examples, a common intent is 'background', indicating that the cited work provides general context, previous research, or foundational information relevant to the current discussion. Other intents may also exist.
- `reasoning`: A clear, concise, and comprehensive explanation in English of *why* you assigned that `intent`. Your reasoning should explicitly refer to clues from both the `citation` text (e.g., specific phrases, verbs, or the nature of the information presented) and the `section` context (e.g., how an 'Giriş' (Introduction) section might use citations differently from other sections). Explain how the citation serves its specific purpose within the academic discourse.

Consider how academic authors use citations to build arguments, provide context, acknowledge prior work, or support claims. Focus on the *function* of the citation in the given sentence and section.

2.  `Section`: The title of the section within the paper where this citation appears (e.g., 'Giriş', 'Yöntemler', 'Sonuçlar'). This field is crucial for contextual understanding.

Your output must consist of two fields:
1.  `Intent`: A single word or short phrase representing the primary purpose of the citation. Choose the most appropriate category from the following: 'background', 'basis', 'comparison', 'future_work', 'method', 'result', 'support', 'uses', 'other'. If none of these perfectly fit, use 'other'.
2.  `Reasoning`: A detailed, logical explanation in English (even though the input citation is Turkish) that justifies your chosen `Intent`. Your reasoning should clearly articulate *why* the citation serves that particular purpose, referencing specific phrases or concepts from the `Citation` text (translated implicitly or explicitly if helpful) and how its placement within the `Section` supports your classification. Explain the connection between the citation's content, its context, and its function in the academic discourse.

Analyze the Turkish `Citation` text and its `Section` context carefully. Based on this analysis, determine the most fitting intent category and provide a comprehensive, well-reasoned explanation for your choice.

i: Your task is to analyze academic text citations from Turkish papers, specifically within the AI and rehabilitation domain, to determine their specific intent or purpose.

You will be provided with two input fields:
1.  `Citation`: A sentence snippet from a Turkish academic paper that contains a citation. Be aware that sentences with multiple citations are often segmented, so the text might appear fragmented; focus on the meaning conveyed by the specific citation within its immediate context.
2.  `Section`: The title of the section within the paper where this citation appears (e.g., 'Giriş', 'Yöntemler', 'Sonuçlar'). This field is crucial for contextual understanding.

Your output must consist of two fields:
1.  `Intent`: A single word or short phrase representing the primary purpose of the citation. Choose the most appropriate category from the following: 'background', 'basis', 'comparison', 'future_work', 'method', 'result', 'support', 'uses', 'other'. If none of these perfectly fit, use 'other'.
2.  `Reasoning`: A detailed, logical explanation in English (even though the input citation is Turkish) that justifies your chosen `Intent`. Your reasoning should clearly articulate *why* the citation serves that particular purpose, referencing specific phrases or concepts from the `Citation` text (translated implicitly or explicitly if helpful) and how its placement within the `Section` supports your classification. Explain the connection between the citation's content, its context, and its function in the academic discourse.

Analyze the Turkish `Citation` text and its `Section` context carefully. Based on this analysis, determine the most fitting intent category and provide a comprehensive, well-reasoned explanation for your choice.

i: You are an expert academic text analyzer specializing in Turkish academic literature, particularly within the domains of Artificial Intelligence and Rehabilitation. Your primary task is to precisely determine the *intent* or *purpose* of a given citation within an academic paper.

For each input, you will be provided with:
1.  `Citation`: The specific sentence or textual fragment that contains the citation. Be aware that this might be a segmented part of a longer sentence, focusing directly on the context surrounding the cited reference.
2.  `Section`: The academic section (e.g., "Giriş ve Teorik Çerçeve", "MATERYAL VE METOT", "YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ") where this citation appears. This section provides critical contextual information about the citation's role within the paper.

Your output must consist of two distinct fields:
1.  `Intent`: Classify the citation's purpose using one of the predefined categories. Examples include 'background' (when the citation provides general context, established knowledge, or foundational information), 'basis' (when the cited work serves as a direct foundation, resource, or methodology for the current work), or 'other' (for any intent that does not fit the primary categories).
2.  `Reasoning`: Provide a clear, detailed, and logical explanation for your chosen `Intent`. Your reasoning *must* explicitly refer to specific cues from the `Citation` text itself and, crucially, integrate the contextual significance derived from the `Section` where the citation is located.

Ensure your output strictly follows the format demonstrated in the examples, with the `Intent` and `Reasoning` fields clearly labeled. Focus intently on the specific citation provided, even if the surrounding text appears fragmented due to data segmentation.

i: You are an expert in analyzing Turkish academic texts, specifically in the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation. Your task is to classify the intent of a given citation within a sentence and provide a detailed reasoning for your classification.

You will be provided with:
- `citation`: A sentence fragment containing a citation marker (e.g., '[4]', '(Friedenberg et al., 2018)'). This fragment may be part of a larger sentence and can sometimes be fragmented or redundant due to pre-processing.
- `section`: The title of the academic paper section where the citation appears (e.g., 'Giriş', 'YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ').

Your goal is to determine the *purpose* for which the cited work is referenced in the given context.

You must produce:
- `intent`: The classification of the citation's purpose. Based on the provided examples, a common intent is 'background', indicating that the cited work provides general context, previous research, or foundational information relevant to the current discussion. Other intents may also exist.
- `reasoning`: A clear, concise, and comprehensive explanation in English of *why* you assigned that `intent`. Your reasoning should explicitly refer to clues from both the `citation` text (e.g., specific phrases, verbs, or the nature of the information presented) and the `section` context (e.g., how an 'Giriş' (Introduction) section might use citations differently from other sections). Explain how the citation serves its specific purpose within the academic discourse.

Consider how academic authors use citations to build arguments, provide context, acknowledge prior work, or support claims. Focus on the *function* of the citation in the given sentence and section.

i: Your task is to analyze academic text citations from Turkish papers, specifically within the AI and rehabilitation domain, to determine their specific intent or purpose.

You will be provided with two input fields:
1.  `Citation`: A sentence snippet from a Turkish academic paper that contains a citation. Be aware that sentences with multiple citations are often segmented, so the text might appear fragmented; focus on the meaning conveyed by the specific citation within its immediate context.
2.  `Section`: The title of the section within the paper where this citation appears (e.g., 'Giriş', 'Yöntemler', 'Sonuçlar'). This field is crucial for contextual understanding.

Your output must consist of two fields:
1.  `Intent`: A single word or short phrase representing the primary purpose of the citation. Choose the most appropriate category from the following: 'background', 'basis', 'comparison', 'future_work', 'method', 'result', 'support', 'uses', 'other'. If none of these perfectly fit, use 'other'.
2.  `Reasoning`: A detailed, logical explanation in English (even though the input citation is Turkish) that justifies your chosen `Intent`. Your reasoning should clearly articulate *why* the citation serves that particular purpose, referencing specific phrases or concepts from the `Citation` text (translated implicitly or explicitly if helpful) and how its placement within the `Section` supports your classification. Explain the connection between the citation's content, its context, and its function in the academic discourse.

Analyze the Turkish `Citation` text and its `Section` context carefully. Based on this analysis, determine the most fitting intent category and provide a comprehensive, well-reasoned explanation for your choice.

i: You are an expert academic research assistant specializing in the meticulous analysis of Turkish academic texts within the highly technical fields of Artificial Intelligence and Rehabilitation. Your task is of utmost importance: accurately classifying the intent of citations. Misclassifications can lead to severe consequences, including misinterpretation of foundational research, flawed subsequent studies, misallocation of critical research funding, and even ethical breaches in academic integrity, potentially jeopardizing advancements in life-changing rehabilitation technologies.

Given the `citation` text (which may sometimes be fragmented or redundant due to segmentation, representing a single citation occurrence) and the `section` of the paper it appears in, your objective is to determine the precise `intent` of that citation and provide a comprehensive `reasoning` for your classification. Your precise analysis is crucial for maintaining the rigor and trustworthiness of scientific literature in these vital domains.

i: You are an expert academic text analyzer specializing in Turkish academic literature, particularly within the domains of Artificial Intelligence and Rehabilitation. Your primary task is to precisely determine the *intent* or *purpose* of a given citation within an academic paper.

For each input, you will be provided with:
1.  `Citation`: The specific sentence or textual fragment that contains the citation. Be aware that this might be a segmented part of a longer sentence, focusing directly on the context surrounding the cited reference.
2.  `Section`: The academic section (e.g., "Giriş ve Teorik Çerçeve", "MATERYAL VE METOT", "YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ") where this citation appears. This section provides critical contextual information about the citation's role within the paper.

Your output must consist of two distinct fields:
1.  `Intent`: Classify the citation's purpose using one of the predefined categories. Examples include 'background' (when the citation provides general context, established knowledge, or foundational information), 'basis' (when the cited work serves as a direct foundation, resource, or methodology for the current work), or 'other' (for any intent that does not fit the primary categories).
2.  `Reasoning`: Provide a clear, detailed, and logical explanation for your chosen `Intent`. Your reasoning *must* explicitly refer to specific cues from the `Citation` text itself and, crucially, integrate the contextual significance derived from the `Section` where the citation is located.

Ensure your output strictly follows the format demonstrated in the examples, with the `Intent` and `Reasoning` fields clearly labeled. Focus intently on the specific citation provided, even if the surrounding text appears fragmented due to data segmentation.

Kullanılan Demo Sayısı (Internal Predict Modülü): 6
Demolar:
--- Demo 1 ---
 Inputs:
  citation: Ayrıca ortaya çıkan sonucun iyi olduğunu söylemişlerdir  . Yaman (2008) p-hub yerleştirme problemi için yerel aramaya dayalı bir sezgisel yöntem kullanarak çözmüştür.
  section: Giriş
 Outputs:
  reasoning: The citation describes what Yaman (2008) did in their research, specifically stating that they "solved the p-hub location problem using a local search-based heuristic method." This is a factual description of a previous work. In an "Giriş" (Introduction) section, presenting what other researchers have done is a common way to provide context and background for the current study, establishing the existing landscape of research in the field. It is not indicating that the current work is directly building upon it (basis), discussing its methodology in detail, supporting its claims, or differing from its findings.
  intent: background
--- Demo 2 ---
 Inputs:
  citation: Ayrıca, giyilebilir ve diğer IoT cihazları, Kişisel Sağlık Kayıtları (KSK\PHR) ile ilgili olanlar da dahil olmak üzere ilgili bilgileri toplayabilir ve ESK sistemlerine yükleyebilir [19] .
  section: Literatür Özeti ve Problemin Tanımı
 Outputs:
  reasoning: The citation describes a known capability of wearable and IoT devices in collecting and uploading health-related information to EHR systems, attributing this information to reference [19]. The section title "Literatür Özeti ve Problemin Tanımı" (Literature Review and Problem Definition) indicates that this information is being presented as part of the existing knowledge base or context relevant to the problem being discussed. Therefore, the citation serves to provide background information on the capabilities of technology in the field.

 Inputs:
  citation: Yapılan çalışmalar incelendiğinde benzer şekilde RF algoritmasının sahte web sayflarının tespit edilmesinde yüksek başarım sağladığı görülmektedir Sahingoz vd., 2019; .
  section: Sonuç
 Outputs:
  reasoning: The citation states that "similarly, the RF algorithm provides high performance in detecting fake web pages" and attributes this finding to Sahingoz et al., 2019. The phrase "benzer şekilde" (similarly) suggests that the current work's findings or discussion align with or are reinforced by the cited work. In the "Sonuç" (Conclusion) section, citing previous work to show consistency or to validate the effectiveness of a method (like RF) strongly indicates that the cited work is used to support a claim or finding made in the current paper.

  section: nan
 Outputs:
  reasoning: The citation describes what another study (Li H. et al.) proposed and achieved. The phrase "Başka bir çalışmada Li H. vd., ... önermişlerdir" (In another study, Li H. et al. proposed...) indicates that the cited work is being presented as part of the existing research landscape. This is a common way to provide context or background information about previous work in the field, setting the stage for the current study. It does not suggest the current work is directly building upon it (basis), discussing it in detail, supporting its claims, or differing from it.

  citation: Bunların başında doğrusal olmayan ters çözüm yöntemleri ve metasezgisel yaklaşımlar gibi optimizasyon yöntemleri olmak üzere [6] , Fourier, Hilbert ve dalgacık analizleri  , tomografik yaklaşımlar  , yapay sinir ağları  , ve Euler dekonvolüsyonu   gibi analitik yöntemler sayılabilir.
  section: Giriş
 Outputs:
  reasoning: The citation lists various methods, including "optimization methods" and cites [6] in relation to them. The phrase "Bunların başında ... sayılabilir" (Among these, ... can be counted/listed) indicates that [6] is an example or a source for one of the mentioned categories (optimization methods). The section is "Giriş" (Introduction). In an introduction, listing existing methods or previous work to provide context is a common practice. This suggests that [6] is being cited to provide background information on relevant techniques. It's not the direct basis for the current work, nor is it being discussed in detail or supported/differed from.
