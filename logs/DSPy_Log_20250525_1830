SOURCE CODE: StringSignature(citation, section -> reasoning, intent
    instructions='You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.\nYour goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:\n1.  **background**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper\'s core work.\n    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Giriş\' (Introduction), \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work), \'Genel Bilgiler\' (General Information).\n    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.\n\n2.  **basis**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Yöntem\' (Methodology), \'Materyal ve Metot\' (Material and Method), \'Model Tasarımı\' (Model Design), \'Veri Seti\' (Dataset), \'Uygulama\' (Implementation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The current study\'s methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.\n\n3.  **discuss**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work\'s importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Bulgular ve Tartışma\' (Results and Discussion), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.\n\n4.  **support**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Doğrulama\' (Validation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study\'s findings by demonstrating consistency.\n\n5.  **differ**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study\'s findings.\n\n6.  **other**:\n    * **Description**: The citation\'s rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don\'t fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).\n    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.\n    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.\n\n**Important Considerations for Classification**:\n* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.\n* **Context is Key**: While the \'section\' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the \'citation\' text itself. A citation\'s intent might occasionally differ from its section\'s typical use.\n* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.\n\n**Input Format**:\nEach citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:\n* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).\n* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).\n* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).\n\nAll citations will be presented as a JSON array.\nExample of Input Data Structure:\n[\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_1",\n    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",\n    "section": "Giriş"\n  },\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_2",\n    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",\n    "section": "Yöntem"\n  }\n]\n\n**Expected Output Format**:\nThe output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.\nExample of Output Data Structure:\n[\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_1",\n    "intent": "background"\n  },\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_2",\n    "intent": "basis"\n  }\n]\n\nPlease return your response strictly as a valid JSON array.

DATA SUMMARY: This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations within Turkish research papers. It takes as input a citation sentence or excerpt and the title of the section in which it appears, both provided in Turkish. The program's core task is to assign each citation to one of six predefined categories: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', or 'other', based on its contextual meaning and purpose within the paper.

The program operates by leveraging a large language model (LLM) configured with a specific `StringSignature`. This signature defines the inputs (`citation` and `section`) and the required outputs (`reasoning` and `intent`). The `instructions` embedded within the signature provide the LLM with a detailed persona (an expert academic editor specializing in AI/CS), a comprehensive description of the classification task, and meticulous definitions for each of the six intent categories. These definitions include descriptions, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification schema, and typical Turkish section titles where such citations might appear, aiding the LLM in its decision-making.

Crucially, the program employs a `ChainOfThought` prompting strategy. This means that for each citation, the LLM is first prompted to generate a step-by-step `reasoning` process for its classification before producing the final `intent` category. This intermediate reasoning step enhances the LLM's ability to systematically analyze the input and provides transparency into its decision-making process. The output is formatted as a JSON array, containing the unique ID of each citation and its classified intent.

Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module represents the core inference step of the `ClassifyCitation` program. It acts as the public interface for performing the citation intent classification. When invoked, it takes a Turkish `citation` sentence/excerpt and its corresponding `section` title as input. Internally, this module delegates the classification task to a `dspy.ChainOfThought` instance (`self.classifier`), which is configured with the detailed `CitationIntentSignature`. This `ChainOfThought` module then prompts the underlying language model to first generate a step-by-step `reasoning` for its decision and subsequently output the final rhetorical `intent` category for the given citation. Thus, this module encapsulates the entire process of analyzing the input citation and producing both the justification and the classification.

You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. Specifically, it aims to determine *why* a particular work is cited by analyzing the citation sentence itself and the section of the paper where it appears.

The program operates by taking two primary inputs:
1.  `citation`: The specific sentence or excerpt from the research paper that contains the citation. This text is in Turkish.
2.  `section`: The title of the section (also in Turkish) in which the citation is located, providing contextual clues.

It then processes these inputs to produce two outputs:
1.  `reasoning`: A step-by-step justification for the classification decision, explaining how the model arrived at its conclusion.
2.  `intent`: The classified rhetorical intent, chosen from one of six predefined categories:
    *   **background**: For general context, historical information, or foundational studies not directly built upon.
    *   **basis**: When the current study directly uses or adapts methods, algorithms, or data from the cited work.
    *   **discuss**: When the cited work is actively and substantively analyzed, discussed, or critically evaluated.
    *   **support**: When the cited work's findings are consistent with and reinforce the current study's results.
    *   **differ**: When the cited work's findings contrast with, contradict, or highlight different perspectives compared to the current study's results.
    *   **other**: When the intent cannot be confidently determined due to insufficient information, semantic weakness, or a purely bibliographic mention.

The program is implemented as a `dspy.ChainOfThought` model, which means it is instructed to generate a detailed reasoning process before outputting the final classification. It acts as an "expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence," and the classification categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) schema, refined with specific guidelines and typical Turkish section names to aid in classification. The task is performed in a zero-shot manner, relying solely on the provided instructions and category definitions to classify Turkish-language content.
task_demos Citation: Mikroservis yazılım mimarileri monolit ve SOA mimarinin güçlü yönlerini bir araya getirir [8] .
Section: Giriş
Reasoning: The citation states that "Microservice software architectures combine the strengths of monolithic and SOA architectures." This is a general descriptive statement about microservices, providing foundational information or context. The section is "Giriş" (Introduction), which is a typical section for providing background information. The citation does not indicate that the current study is directly using methods from [8], discussing [8]'s work in detail, or comparing results. Therefore, it serves to provide general background knowledge.
Intent: background

Citation: Dünya nüfusunun artışıyla birlikte yaşlılık, kazalar, hastalıklar ve savaşlar gibi sebeplerden dolayı rehabilitasyon hizmetlerine duyulan ihtiyaç giderek daha çok önem kazanmıştır (Akdemir & Akkuş, 2006) .
Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: The citation states a general fact about the increasing importance of rehabilitation services due to various global factors, citing Akdemir & Akkuş (2006). This information serves to provide general context and set the stage for the research, rather than detailing a method, discussing the cited work in depth, or comparing specific results. The section title "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) further supports this, as introductions typically provide background information. Therefore, the intent is 'background'.
Intent: background

Citation: Dünya çapında nüfusun sağlığında ve özelliklerinde meydana gelen değişikliklerle birlikte, bu tahmini rehabilitasyon ihtiyacının önümüzdeki yıllarda artacağı öngörülmektedir (Cieza et al., 2020) .
Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: The citation states a global prediction regarding the increasing need for rehabilitation, attributing this information to Cieza et al. (2020). This statement serves to provide general context and highlight the significance or prevalence of the topic, setting the stage for the current research. The section is "GİRİŞ" (Introduction), which is a typical section for providing background information. The cited work is not being directly built upon methodologically, nor is it being discussed in detail, nor are its results being compared for support or difference. Therefore, it functions as general background information.

[[ ## dataset_description ## ]]
This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

[[ ## program_description ## ]]
This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. Specifically, it aims to determine *why* a particular work is cited by analyzing the citation sentence itself and the section of the paper where it appears.

The program operates by taking two primary inputs:
1.  `citation`: The specific sentence or excerpt from the research paper that contains the citation. This text is in Turkish.
2.  `section`: The title of the section (also in Turkish) in which the citation is located, providing contextual clues.

It then processes these inputs to produce two outputs:
1.  `reasoning`: A step-by-step justification for the classification decision, explaining how the model arrived at its conclusion.
2.  `intent`: The classified rhetorical intent, chosen from one of six predefined categories:
    *   **background**: For general context, historical information, or foundational studies not directly built upon.

Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module, represented by `self.classifier` in the `ClassifyCitation` program, is the core component responsible for performing the actual rhetorical intent classification of academic citations.

Its role in the broader program is to:
1.  **Receive Inputs**: Take the `citation` (the Turkish text of the citation sentence) and the `section` (the Turkish title of the section where the citation appears) as its primary inputs.
2.  **Execute Classification Logic**: Apply the detailed instructions and category definitions provided in the `CitationIntentSignature` to analyze the semantic content and rhetorical function of the citation within its given context.
3.  **Generate Reasoning**: As a `dspy.ChainOfThought` model, it first generates a step-by-step `reasoning` process. This internal thought process explains *why* a particular classification is made, analyzing the input against the criteria for each of the six intent categories (`background`, `basis`, `discuss`, `support`, `differ`, `other`). This ensures transparency and explainability in the classification.
4.  **Determine Intent**: Based on the generated reasoning, it then outputs the final `intent`—the classified rhetorical purpose of the citation, selected from the predefined set of categories.

In essence, this module embodies the "expert academic editor" persona, performing the analytical work to classify the citation's intent according to the specified schema and providing a justification for its decision.

You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.

You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. It takes as input a specific citation sentence or excerpt (in Turkish) and the title of the section (also in Turkish) where that citation appears.

The program operates by leveraging a language model, configured as an "expert academic editor," to perform a zero-shot classification. It provides the language model with highly detailed instructions, including:
1.  **Six predefined categories** for rhetorical intent: `background`, `basis`, `discuss`, `support`, `differ`, and `other`.
2.  **Comprehensive descriptions** for each category, outlining their purpose, typical use cases, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification schema, and common Turkish section titles where such citations might appear.
3.  **Key considerations** for classification, emphasizing that while the section title provides context, the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content of the citation text itself.

For each input citation and section, the program first prompts the language model to generate a `reasoning` step, explaining its thought process and justification for the classification. This chain-of-thought approach helps ensure a more robust and explainable output. Following this reasoning, the model then outputs the final `intent` label, selected from the six predefined categories. The entire process is designed to handle Turkish input and produce structured JSON output, making it suitable for automated analysis of academic texts.
task_demos Citation: Dünya nüfusunun artışıyla birlikte yaşlılık, kazalar, hastalıklar ve savaşlar gibi sebeplerden dolayı rehabilitasyon hizmetlerine duyulan ihtiyaç giderek daha çok önem kazanmıştır (Akdemir & Akkuş, 2006) .
Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: The citation states a general fact about the increasing importance of rehabilitation services due to various global factors, citing Akdemir & Akkuş (2006). This information serves to provide general context and set the stage for the research, rather than detailing a method, discussing the cited work in depth, or comparing specific results. The section title "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) further supports this, as introductions typically provide background information. Therefore, the intent is 'background'.
Intent: background

Citation: Dünya çapında nüfusun sağlığında ve özelliklerinde meydana gelen değişikliklerle birlikte, bu tahmini rehabilitasyon ihtiyacının önümüzdeki yıllarda artacağı öngörülmektedir (Cieza et al., 2020) .
Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: The citation states a global prediction regarding the increasing need for rehabilitation, attributing this information to Cieza et al. (2020). This statement serves to provide general context and highlight the significance or prevalence of the topic, setting the stage for the current research. The section is "GİRİŞ" (Introduction), which is a typical section for providing background information. The cited work is not being directly built upon methodologically, nor is it being discussed in detail, nor are its results being compared for support or difference. Therefore, it functions as general background information.
Intent: background

Citation: Teleseptif algılama, RGB kamera (Red (kırmızı) ,  , Blue (mavi) renklerinden oluşmuş, bir renk sistemidir), Kızılötesi (IR) sensör, Ultrasonik sensör veya Radar gibi kullanıcı dışındaki şeylerin ortamını veya davranışını dolaylı olarak ölçen herhangi bir sensörü içermektedir (Krausz & Hargrove, 2019) .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: The citation defines "teleseptif algılama" (teleseptive sensing) and lists examples of sensors, attributing this general information to Krausz & Hargrove (2019). This serves to provide foundational knowledge or general context for a concept relevant to the paper's subject, rather than describing a method directly used by the current study, discussing the cited work in detail, or comparing results. The section title, "YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ," is broad and could encompass such definitional background.
Intent: background

    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",

  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",

[[ ## dataset_description ## ]]
This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

[[ ## program_description ## ]]
This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. It takes as input a specific citation sentence or excerpt (in Turkish) and the title of the section (also in Turkish) where that citation appears.

The program operates by leveraging a language model, configured as an "expert academic editor," to perform a zero-shot classification. It provides the language model with highly detailed instructions, including:
1.  **Six predefined categories** for rhetorical intent: `background`, `basis`, `discuss`, `support`, `differ`, and `other`.
2.  **Comprehensive descriptions** for each category, outlining their purpose, typical use cases, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification schema, and common Turkish section titles where such citations might appear.
3.  **Key considerations** for classification, emphasizing that while the section title provides context, the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content of the citation text itself.

For each input citation and section, the program first prompts the language model to generate a `reasoning` step, explaining its thought process and justification for the classification. This chain-of-thought approach helps ensure a more robust and explainable output. Following this reasoning, the model then outputs the final `intent` label, selected from the six predefined categories. The entire process is designed to handle Turkish input and produce structured JSON output, making it suitable for automated analysis of academic texts.

[[ ## module ## ]]
Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module represents the core inference step of the program. It takes a Turkish `citation` string and its corresponding `section` title as input. Its primary role is to leverage the configured language model (specifically, the `dspy.ChainOfThought` classifier using the `CitationIntentSignature`) to determine the rhetorical intent of the given citation.

Specifically, this module performs the following actions:
1.  **Receives Inputs**: It accepts the `citation` text and `section` title for analysis.
2.  **Invokes Classifier**: It passes these inputs to the `classifier` (a `ChainOfThought` instance), which is pre-configured with detailed instructions and categories for rhetorical intent classification.
3.  **Generates Reasoning**: As part of the Chain-of-Thought process, the language model first generates a `reasoning` string. This output explains the step-by-step justification for the classification decision, providing transparency and interpretability.
4.  **Classifies Intent**: Based on its analysis and reasoning, the language model then determines and outputs the final `intent` label, selecting one of the six predefined categories: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', or 'other'.

In essence, this module encapsulates the entire process of taking raw citation data, applying the expert knowledge embedded in the language model's prompt, and producing both the classified intent and the rationale behind it.

[[ ## task_demos ## ]]
Citation: Dünya nüfusunun artışıyla birlikte yaşlılık, kazalar, hastalıklar ve savaşlar gibi sebeplerden dolayı rehabilitasyon hizmetlerine duyulan ihtiyaç giderek daha çok önem kazanmıştır (Akdemir & Akkuş, 2006) .
Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: The citation states a general fact about the increasing importance of rehabilitation services due to various global factors, citing Akdemir & Akkuş (2006). This information serves to provide general context and set the stage for the research, rather than detailing a method, discussing the cited work in depth, or comparing specific results. The section title "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) further supports this, as introductions typically provide background information. Therefore, the intent is 'background'.
Intent: background

Citation: Dünya çapında nüfusun sağlığında ve özelliklerinde meydana gelen değişikliklerle birlikte, bu tahmini rehabilitasyon ihtiyacının önümüzdeki yıllarda artacağı öngörülmektedir (Cieza et al., 2020) .
Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: The citation states a global prediction regarding the increasing need for rehabilitation, attributing this information to Cieza et al. (2020). This statement serves to provide general context and highlight the significance or prevalence of the topic, setting the stage for the current research. The section is "GİRİŞ" (Introduction), which is a typical section for providing background information. The cited work is not being directly built upon methodologically, nor is it being discussed in detail, nor are its results being compared for support or difference. Therefore, it functions as general background information.
Intent: background

Citation: Teleseptif algılama, RGB kamera (Red (kırmızı) ,  , Blue (mavi) renklerinden oluşmuş, bir renk sistemidir), Kızılötesi (IR) sensör, Ultrasonik sensör veya Radar gibi kullanıcı dışındaki şeylerin ortamını veya davranışını dolaylı olarak ölçen herhangi bir sensörü içermektedir (Krausz & Hargrove, 2019) .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: The citation defines "teleseptif algılama" (teleseptive sensing) and lists examples of sensors, attributing this general information to Krausz & Hargrove (2019). This serves to provide foundational knowledge or general context for a concept relevant to the paper's subject, rather than describing a method directly used by the current study, discussing the cited work in detail, or comparing results. The section title, "YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ," is broad and could encompass such definitional background.

Predictor 0
i: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"

i: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

Tahmin edilen intent: support
Gerekçe: The citation explicitly states that "Our method produces similar results to approaches in the literature (Çelik ve Aydın, 2022)." This indicates a direct comparison where the findings of the current study are consistent with those of the cited work. This consistency serves to reinforce or validate the current study's results, which aligns directly with the definition of 'support'. The section title "Bulgular" (Results) further supports this interpretation, as this is where such comparisons of findings are typically made.

    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.

 Inputs:
  citation: Teleseptif algılama, RGB kamera (Red (kırmızı) ,  , Blue (mavi) renklerinden oluşmuş, bir renk sistemidir), Kızılötesi (IR) sensör, Ultrasonik sensör veya Radar gibi kullanıcı dışındaki şeylerin ortamını veya davranışını dolaylı olarak ölçen herhangi bir sensörü içermektedir (Krausz & Hargrove, 2019) .
  section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
 Outputs:
  reasoning: The citation defines "teleseptif algılama" (teleseptive sensing) and lists examples of sensors, attributing this general information to Krausz & Hargrove (2019). This serves to provide foundational knowledge or general context for a concept relevant to the paper's subject, rather than describing a method directly used by the current study, discussing the cited work in detail, or comparing results. The section title, "YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ," is broad and could encompass such definitional background.
  intent: background

 Inputs:
  citation: Bu tartışmalarda çoğunlukla, açık ve saydamiletişim mekanizmalarının yanı sıra doğrudan katılımı sağlayan süreçlerin geliştirilmesine ve güven mekanizmalarının artırılmasına odaklanılmaktadır [4] .
  section: Giriş
 Outputs:
  reasoning: The citation states that "In these discussions, the focus is mostly on developing processes that ensure direct participation, as well as open and transparent communication mechanisms, and increasing trust mechanisms [4]." This sentence provides general information about the common focus of discussions within a particular field, setting the broader context for the current study. It does not indicate that the current study is directly building upon the methods or data of the cited work, nor is it discussing the cited work in detail, or comparing results. The section is "Giriş" (Introduction), which is a typical section for providing background information. Therefore, the citation serves to orient the reader within the scholarly area by providing general context.

            * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
            * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
            * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
            * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.
        
        6.  **other**:
            * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
            * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
            * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.
        
        **Important Considerations for Classification**:
        * **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
        * **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
        * **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.
        
        **Input Format**:
        Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
        * `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
        * `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
        * `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).
        
        All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
        Example of Input Data Structure:
        [
          {
            "id": "unique_id_1",
            "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
            "section": "Giriş"
          },
          {
            "id": "unique_id_2",
            "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
            "section": "Yöntem"
          }
        ]
        
        **Expected Output Format**:
        The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
        Example of Output Data Structure:
        [
          {
            "id": "unique_id_1",
            "intent": "background"
          },
          {
            "id": "unique_id_2",
            "intent": "basis"
          }
        ]
        
        Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

The citation defines "teleseptif algılama" (teleseptive sensing) and lists examples of sensors, attributing this general information to Krausz & Hargrove (2019). This serves to provide foundational knowledge or general context for a concept relevant to the paper's subject, rather than describing a method directly used by the current study, discussing the cited work in detail, or comparing results. The section title, "YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ," is broad and could encompass such definitional background.

The citation states that "In these discussions, the focus is mostly on developing processes that ensure direct participation, as well as open and transparent communication mechanisms, and increasing trust mechanisms [4]." This sentence provides general information about the common focus of discussions within a particular field, setting the broader context for the current study. It does not indicate that the current study is directly building upon the methods or data of the cited work, nor is it discussing the cited work in detail, or comparing results. The section is "Giriş" (Introduction), which is a typical section for providing background information. Therefore, the citation serves to orient the reader within the scholarly area by providing general context.

Response:

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The citation explicitly states that "Our method produces similar results to approaches in the literature (Çelik ve Aydın, 2022)." This indicates a direct comparison where the findings of the current study are consistent with those of the cited work. This consistency serves to reinforce or validate the current study's results, which aligns directly with the definition of 'support'. The section title "Bulgular" (Results) further supports this interpretation, as this is where such comparisons of findings are typically made.
