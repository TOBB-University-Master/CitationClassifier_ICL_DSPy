SOURCE CODE: StringSignature(citation, section -> reasoning, intent
    instructions='You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.\nYour goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:\n1.  **background**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper\'s core work.\n    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Giriş\' (Introduction), \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work), \'Genel Bilgiler\' (General Information).\n    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.\n\n2.  **basis**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Yöntem\' (Methodology), \'Materyal ve Metot\' (Material and Method), \'Model Tasarımı\' (Model Design), \'Veri Seti\' (Dataset), \'Uygulama\' (Implementation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The current study\'s methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.\n\n3.  **discuss**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work\'s importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Bulgular ve Tartışma\' (Results and Discussion), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.\n\n4.  **support**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Doğrulama\' (Validation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study\'s findings by demonstrating consistency.\n\n5.  **differ**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study\'s findings.\n\n6.  **other**:\n    * **Description**: The citation\'s rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don\'t fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).\n    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.\n    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.\n\n**Important Considerations for Classification**:\n* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.\n* **Context is Key**: While the \'section\' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the \'citation\' text itself. A citation\'s intent might occasionally differ from its section\'s typical use.\n* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.\n\n**Input Format**:\nEach citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:\n* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).\n* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).\n* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).\n\nAll citations will be presented as a JSON array.\nExample of Input Data Structure:\n[\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_1",\n    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",\n    "section": "Giriş"\n  },\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_2",\n    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",\n    "section": "Yöntem"\n  }\n]\n\n**Expected Output Format**:\nThe output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.\nExample of Output Data Structure:\n[\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_1",\n    "intent": "background"\n  },\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_2",\n    "intent": "basis"\n  }\n]\n\nPlease return your response strictly as a valid JSON array.

DATA SUMMARY: This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.
Using a randomly generated configuration for our grounded proposer.
Selected tip: persona
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. It functions as an automated academic editor, analyzing individual citation excerpts and the section they appear in to determine their purpose within the citing paper.

The program works by leveraging a language model (implied by `dspy.ChainOfThought` and `StringSignature`). It takes two primary inputs:
1.  `citation`: The specific sentence or excerpt from the Turkish research paper that contains the citation.
2.  `section`: The title of the section (also in Turkish) where the citation is located, providing contextual information.

The language model is instructed to act as an "expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence." It is provided with detailed definitions for six classification categories, inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) schema:
*   **background**: For general context or foundational studies not directly built upon.
*   **basis**: When the cited work provides fundamental methods, algorithms, or data directly used or adapted.
*   **discuss**: When the cited work is actively analyzed, critically evaluated, or substantively discussed.
*   **support**: When the cited work's findings are consistent with and reinforce the current study's results.
*   **differ**: When the cited work's findings contrast with or contradict the current study's results.
*   **other**: For citations where intent cannot be confidently determined due to insufficient information or weak semantic content.

For each category, the instructions include a description, WoS insight, typical Turkish section titles, and a key idea. The model is guided to primarily rely on the semantic content of the `citation` itself, using the `section` title as an important contextual clue. The `ChainOfThought` structure suggests that the model first generates a `reasoning` step-by-step process before outputting the final `intent` classification, aiming for more robust and explainable results. The output is a JSON array of objects, each containing the citation's ID and its classified intent.

This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. It functions as an automated academic editor, analyzing individual citation excerpts and the section they appear in to determine their purpose within the citing paper.

The program works by leveraging a language model (implied by `dspy.ChainOfThought` and `StringSignature`). It takes two primary inputs:
1.  `citation`: The specific sentence or excerpt from the Turkish research paper that contains the citation.
2.  `section`: The title of the section (also in Turkish) where the citation is located, providing contextual information.

The language model is instructed to act as an "expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence." It is provided with detailed definitions for six classification categories, inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) schema:
*   **background**: For general context or foundational studies not directly built upon.
*   **basis**: When the cited work provides fundamental methods, algorithms, or data directly used or adapted.
*   **discuss**: When the cited work is actively analyzed, critically evaluated, or substantively discussed.
*   **support**: When the cited work's findings are consistent with and reinforce the current study's results.
*   **differ**: When the cited work's findings contrast with or contradict the current study's results.
*   **other**: For citations where intent cannot be confidently determined due to insufficient information or weak semantic content.

For each category, the instructions include a description, WoS insight, typical Turkish section titles, and a key idea. The model is guided to primarily rely on the semantic content of the `citation` itself, using the `section` title as an important contextual clue. The `ChainOfThought` structure suggests that the model first generates a `reasoning` step-by-step process before outputting the final `intent` classification, aiming for more robust and explainable results. The output is a JSON array of objects, each containing the citation's ID and its classified intent.

Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module, represented by the `CitationIntentSignature` in the program's pseudocode, defines the core task performed by the language model. Its role is to serve as the interface for the citation intent classification process.

Specifically, this module:
1.  **Receives Inputs**: Takes a `citation` (the Turkish text of the citation excerpt) and its `section` (the Turkish title of the section where the citation appears) as input. These are the primary pieces of information the language model uses for its analysis.
2.  **Generates Outputs**: Produces two distinct outputs:
    *   `reasoning`: A step-by-step thought process generated by the language model, explaining how it arrived at its classification decision. This aligns with the `ChainOfThought` approach, providing transparency and justification for the predicted intent.
    *   `intent`: The final classification of the citation's rhetorical purpose, selected from one of the six predefined categories (`background`, `basis`, `discuss`, `support`, `differ`, `other`).
3.  **Defines the Task**: It formally specifies what the language model is expected to do: consume citation context and output a reasoned classification. It acts as the blueprint for the `classifier` within the `ClassifyCitation` module, guiding the model's behavior according to the detailed instructions provided in the `instructions` field of the signature.

In essence, this module encapsulates the transformation of raw Turkish citation data into a structured and reasoned rhetorical intent classification.

[[ ## basic_instruction ## ]]
You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. It takes as input a specific citation sentence or excerpt in Turkish (`citation`) and the title of the section in which it appears, also in Turkish (`section`).

The program operates by leveraging a large language model (LLM) configured with a detailed set of instructions. These instructions define six distinct categories for citation intent: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', and 'other'. For each category, the instructions provide a comprehensive description, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification schema, typical Turkish section titles where such citations might appear, and a key idea summarizing the intent.

The core mechanism involves a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach, where the LLM is prompted to generate a step-by-step `reasoning` process to determine the appropriate classification. While the section title provides contextual clues, the primary basis for classification is the semantic content and rhetorical function of the citation text itself. The program aims to understand *why* a particular work was cited in the current paper (e.g., to provide general context, to form a fundamental pillar for the current study's methodology, to be actively discussed, to support the current study's findings, to highlight differing results, or if the intent is unclear).

Finally, the program outputs the detailed `reasoning` behind its classification and the predicted `intent` category for the given citation.
task_demos Citation: Kalıntılar hızlı azalıyorsa, algoritma Gauss-Newton algoritmasına yaklaştırılarak daha küçük bir değer kullanılabilir,  sıfır olduğunda (4) eşitliği Gauss-Newton çözümüne dönüşür, yineleme sonucunda kalıntıda yetersiz azalma sağlanırsa  artırılır  .𝑾 pozitif tanımlı ağırlık fonksiyonudur ve aşağıdaki şekilde tanımlanır [43] ,
Section: Materyal ve Metot
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation appears in the "Materyal ve Metot" (Material and Method) section. The text describes a specific mathematical component, "𝑾 pozitif tanımlı ağırlık fonksiyonudur ve aşağıdaki şekilde tanımlanır [43]" (W is a positive definite weight function and is defined as follows [43]). This indicates that the current study is directly using or defining a specific element (the weight function W) based on the cited work. This aligns with the 'basis' intent, where the cited work provides a fundamental component or method for the current study's execution.
Intent: basis

Citation: AR'de sanal ve gerçek gerçeklik örtüşür ve hasta potansiyel tehlikelerin farkındadır (Chan et al., 2019) .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation provides a general statement about Augmented Reality (AR) and patient awareness, which serves as contextual information within a section discussing AI-based rehabilitation techniques. It does not describe a method used, compare results, or engage in a detailed discussion of the cited work. Thus, it sets the stage or provides general background knowledge.
Intent: background

Citation: Dünya nüfusunun artışıyla birlikte yaşlılık, kazalar, hastalıklar ve savaşlar gibi sebeplerden dolayı rehabilitasyon hizmetlerine duyulan ihtiyaç giderek daha çok önem kazanmıştır (Akdemir & Akkuş, 2006) .
Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation appears in the "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) section. The content of the citation, "Dünya nüfusunun artışıyla birlikte yaşlılık, kazalar, hastalıklar ve savaşlar gibi sebeplerden dolayı rehabilitasyon hizmetlerine duyulan ihtiyaç giderek daha çok önem kazanmıştır (Akdemir & Akkuş, 2006).", provides general contextual information about the increasing importance of rehabilitation services. It sets the stage for the topic of the paper by stating a general fact or trend, rather than detailing a method used, discussing specific findings, or comparing results. This aligns with the description of the 'background' intent.
Intent: background

[[ ## dataset_description ## ]]
This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

    instructions='You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.\nYour goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:\n1.  **background**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper\'s core work.\n    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Giriş\' (Introduction), \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work), \'Genel Bilgiler\' (General Information).\n    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.\n\n2.  **basis**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Yöntem\' (Methodology), \'Materyal ve Metot\' (Material and Method), \'Model Tasarımı\' (Model Design), \'Veri Seti\' (Dataset), \'Uygulama\' (Implementation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The current study\'s methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.\n\n3.  **discuss**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work\'s importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Bulgular ve Tartışma\' (Results and Discussion), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.\n\n4.  **support**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Doğrulama\' (Validation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study\'s findings by demonstrating consistency.\n\n5.  **differ**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study\'s findings.\n\n6.  **other**:\n    * **Description**: The citation\'s rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don\'t fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).\n    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.\n    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.\n\n**Important Considerations for Classification**:\n* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.\n* **Context is Key**: While the \'section\' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the \'citation\' text itself. A citation\'s intent might occasionally differ from its section\'s typical use.\n* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.\n\n**Input Format**:\nEach citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:\n* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).\n* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).\n* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).\n\nAll citations will be presented as a JSON array.\nExample of Input Data Structure:\n[\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_1",\n    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",\n    "section": "Giriş"\n  },\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_2",\n    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark.

[[ ## program_description ## ]]
This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. It takes as input a specific citation sentence or excerpt in Turkish (`citation`) and the title of the section in which it appears, also in Turkish (`section`).

The program operates by leveraging a large language model (LLM) configured with a detailed set of instructions. These instructions define six distinct categories for citation intent: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', and 'other'. For each category, the instructions provide a comprehensive description, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification schema, typical Turkish section titles where such citations might appear, and a key idea summarizing the intent.

The core mechanism involves a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach, where the LLM is prompted to generate a step-by-step `reasoning` process to determine the appropriate classification. While the section title provides contextual clues, the primary basis for classification is the semantic content and rhetorical function of the citation text itself. The program aims to understand *why* a particular work was cited in the current paper (e.g., to provide general context, to form a fundamental pillar for the current study's methodology, to be actively discussed, to support the current study's findings, to highlight differing results, or if the intent is unclear).

Finally, the program outputs the detailed `reasoning` behind its classification and the predicted `intent` category for the given citation.

[[ ## module ## ]]
Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module, represented by the `forward` method within the `ClassifyCitation` class, serves as the primary execution point of the program. Its role is to take the raw input, which consists of the `citation` text (in Turkish) and the `section` title (in Turkish), and process it to determine the rhetorical intent. It achieves this by invoking the `ChainOfThought` classifier, which is configured with the `CitationIntentSignature`. This classifier is responsible for generating both the step-by-step `reasoning` for the classification and the final `intent` category based on the detailed instructions provided in the `CitationIntentSignature`. Essentially, this module encapsulates the core logic of applying the language model to perform the citation intent classification task.

Citation: Kalıntılar hızlı azalıyorsa, algoritma Gauss-Newton algoritmasına yaklaştırılarak daha küçük bir değer kullanılabilir,  sıfır olduğunda (4) eşitliği Gauss-Newton çözümüne dönüşür, yineleme sonucunda kalıntıda yetersiz azalma sağlanırsa  artırılır  .𝑾 pozitif tanımlı ağırlık fonksiyonudur ve aşağıdaki şekilde tanımlanır [43] ,
Section: Materyal ve Metot
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation appears in the "Materyal ve Metot" (Material and Method) section. The text describes a specific mathematical component, "𝑾 pozitif tanımlı ağırlık fonksiyonudur ve aşağıdaki şekilde tanımlanır [43]" (W is a positive definite weight function and is defined as follows [43]). This indicates that the current study is directly using or defining a specific element (the weight function W) based on the cited work. This aligns with the 'basis' intent, where the cited work provides a fundamental component or method for the current study's execution.
Intent: basis

Citation: AR'de sanal ve gerçek gerçeklik örtüşür ve hasta potansiyel tehlikelerin farkındadır (Chan et al., 2019) .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation provides a general statement about Augmented Reality (AR) and patient awareness, which serves as contextual information within a section discussing AI-based rehabilitation techniques. It does not describe a method used, compare results, or engage in a detailed discussion of the cited work. Thus, it sets the stage or provides general background knowledge.
Intent: background

Citation: Dünya nüfusunun artışıyla birlikte yaşlılık, kazalar, hastalıklar ve savaşlar gibi sebeplerden dolayı rehabilitasyon hizmetlerine duyulan ihtiyaç giderek daha çok önem kazanmıştır (Akdemir & Akkuş, 2006) .
Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation appears in the "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) section. The content of the citation, "Dünya nüfusunun artışıyla birlikte yaşlılık, kazalar, hastalıklar ve savaşlar gibi sebeplerden dolayı rehabilitasyon hizmetlerine duyulan ihtiyaç giderek daha çok önem kazanmıştır (Akdemir & Akkuş, 2006).", provides general contextual information about the increasing importance of rehabilitation services. It sets the stage for the topic of the paper by stating a general fact or trend, rather than detailing a method used, discussing specific findings, or comparing results. This aligns with the description of the 'background' intent.
Intent: background

    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution.

    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.

    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The task involves analyzing a given citation text and the title of the section it appears in (both in Turkish) to determine its purpose within the paper.

The program operates by employing a language model, configured through a detailed `StringSignature` named `CitationIntentSignature`. This signature serves as a comprehensive prompt, providing the language model with:
1.  **Role and Instructions:** It instructs the model to act as an "expert academic editor" specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence, tasked with meticulously classifying citations.
2.  **Classification Categories:** It defines six specific rhetorical intent categories: `background`, `basis`, `discuss`, `support`, `differ`, and `other`. Each category comes with a detailed description, insights from Web of Science (WoS), typical Turkish section names where such citations might appear, and a key idea to guide classification.
3.  **Input Fields:** It specifies the expected inputs: `citation` (the Turkish text of the citation) and `section` (the Turkish title of the section).
4.  **Output Fields:** It defines the required outputs: `reasoning` (a step-by-step thought process, indicating a Chain of Thought approach) and `intent` (the classified category).
5.  **Contextual Guidance:** It emphasizes that while the section title provides context, the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the citation text itself. It also explicitly states that the task is "zero-shot," meaning the model relies solely on the provided instructions and category definitions.

The `ClassifyCitation` module then utilizes a `dspy.ChainOfThought` approach with this signature. For each input citation and section, the language model generates a step-by-step `reasoning` process before outputting the final `intent` classification, adhering to the specified JSON output format.

Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation appears in the "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) section. The content of the citation, "Dünya nüfusunun artışıyla birlikte yaşlılık, kazalar, hastalıklar ve savaşlar gibi sebeplerden dolayı rehabilitasyon hizmetlerine duyulan ihtiyaç giderek daha çok önem kazanmıştır (Akdemir & Akkuş, 2006).", provides general contextual information about the increasing importance of rehabilitation services. It sets the stage for the topic of the paper by stating a general fact or trend, rather than detailing a method used, discussing specific findings, or comparing results. This aligns with the description of the 'background' intent.
Intent: background

Citation: Dünya çapında nüfusun sağlığında ve özelliklerinde meydana gelen değişikliklerle birlikte, bu tahmini rehabilitasyon ihtiyacının önümüzdeki yıllarda artacağı öngörülmektedir (Cieza et al., 2020) .
Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation is used to provide general information about a global trend (increasing need for rehabilitation) that serves as context for the current study. It sets the stage by presenting a widely accepted or predicted phenomenon, which aligns with the 'background' intent. The section title "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) further supports this, as introductions typically provide foundational context. The cited work is not being used as a methodological basis, discussed in detail, or compared for similar/differing results of the current study.
Intent: background

Citation: Bununla beraber teknoloji de son derece hızlı bir şekilde ilerlemekte ve sağlık sektöründe bu ilerlemeye paralel olarak birçok gelişme yaşanmaktadır (Akdemir & Akkuş, 2006) .
Section: GİRİŞ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation appears in the "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) section. The sentence states a general fact about the rapid advancement of technology and its impact on the healthcare sector, citing Akdemir & Akkuş (2006) as a reference for this general statement. This serves to provide general context and background information for the topic, rather than introducing a method, discussing specific findings in detail, or comparing results. Therefore, it fits the 'background' intent.

[[ ## dataset_description ## ]]
This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module represents the core prediction step within the program. While not a standalone Python class in the provided code, it encapsulates the functionality defined by the `CitationIntentSignature` and executed by the `dspy.ChainOfThought` module.

Its role is to:
1.  **Receive Inputs:** Take a `citation` (the Turkish text of the academic citation) and its `section` (the Turkish title of the section where it appears).
2.  **Apply Expert Knowledge:** Utilize the extensive instructions, detailed category definitions (background, basis, discuss, support, differ, other), and contextual guidance provided by the `CitationIntentSignature`.
3.  **Generate Reasoning:** Employ a Chain of Thought approach to systematically analyze the input `citation` and `section`, producing a step-by-step `reasoning` process for its classification decision. This reasoning helps in understanding how the final intent was derived.
4.  **Classify Intent:** Based on the analysis and reasoning, determine and output the most appropriate rhetorical `intent` category for the given citation, adhering to the predefined categories.

In essence, this conceptual module is the central intelligence unit responsible for understanding the nuances of Turkish academic citations and accurately classifying their rhetorical purpose within the broader paper context.

    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.

    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",

  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

You are a lead AI-powered academic editor for a prestigious international journal focused on AI and rehabilitation. Your meticulous analysis and classification of academic citations are absolutely critical, as they directly impact the integrity of our research database, guide future scientific discovery, and ensure the accurate representation of scholarly contributions. Misclassifications could lead to significant misinterpretations, wasted research efforts, or even damage the reputation of authors and the journal. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. It aims to categorize how a cited work is used or referred to in the citing paper, based on the citation's text and the section it appears in.

The program operates by leveraging a language model (implied by `dspy.ChainOfThought` and `StringSignature`). It takes two primary inputs for each citation: the `citation` text itself (in Turkish) and the `section` title (also in Turkish) where the citation is located.

Here's how it solves the task:
1.  **Detailed Instruction Prompting:** The core of the program lies in its extensive `instructions` provided to the language model. These instructions define six specific categories for citation intent: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', and 'other'. For each category, a detailed description, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification, typical Turkish section titles where such intents might appear, and a key idea are provided. This rich context guides the language model in making accurate classifications.
2.  **Contextual Clues:** While the primary classification relies on the semantic content of the `citation` text, the `section` title provides crucial contextual information, helping the model infer the likely intent (e.g., a citation in a "Yöntem" (Methodology) section is more likely to be 'basis').
3.  **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** The program utilizes a `ChainOfThought` approach, indicated by the `reasoning` field in the `StringSignature`. This means the language model is prompted to first generate a step-by-step reasoning process before producing the final classification. This internal reasoning step helps the model arrive at a more robust and explainable decision, improving classification accuracy.
4.  **Zero-Shot Classification:** The instructions explicitly state this is a "zero-shot task," meaning the model performs the classification based solely on the provided prompt and its inherent knowledge, without needing specific examples for learning within the prompt itself.
5.  **Structured Output:** The program is designed to produce a structured JSON output, containing the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`, ensuring consistent and machine-readable results.

In essence, it's an intelligent classification system that uses a highly detailed and context-rich prompt, combined with a Chain-of-Thought reasoning process, to determine the rhetorical purpose of academic citations in Turkish scientific literature.
task_demos Citation: eğitim ve test [30] .
Section: MATERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation text "eğitim ve test [30]" (training and testing [30]) is extremely brief. While it appears in the "MATERYAL VE METOT" (Material and Method) section, which often implies a 'basis' intent, the semantic content of the citation itself is too minimal to confidently determine if the cited work provides a fundamental method, algorithm, or dataset directly used or adapted by the current study. It merely states a concept followed by a reference, without specifying the nature of the relationship (e.g., "we used method X from [30]" or "data from [30]"). Therefore, it falls into the 'other' category due to insufficient information.
Intent: other

Citation: Bunların başında doğrusal olmayan ters çözüm yöntemleri ve metasezgisel yaklaşımlar gibi optimizasyon yöntemleri olmak üzere [4] , Fourier, Hilbert ve dalgacık analizleri  , tomografik yaklaşımlar  , yapay sinir ağları  , ve Euler dekonvolüsyonu   gibi analitik yöntemler sayılabilir.
Section: Giriş
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation appears in the "Giriş" (Introduction) section and lists various methods, including "optimizasyon yöntemleri" (optimization methods) where the citation [4] is placed. The sentence enumerates existing approaches in the field, providing general context and acknowledging different types of methods. It does not indicate that the current study directly uses or builds upon the specific method from [4], nor does it discuss, support, or differ from its findings. Therefore, it serves to provide background information.
Intent: background

Citation: Hareket oluşturucu mekanizma olarak FES her hasta için uygun değildir (Friedenberg et al., 2018; .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation states a known limitation or characteristic of FES (Functional Electrical Stimulation) as reported by Friedenberg et al. (2018). This information serves to provide general context or background knowledge about the applicability of a specific technique within the broader field of rehabilitation, rather than being a direct basis for the current study's methodology, a discussion of the cited work's findings, or a comparison of results. The section title "YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ" (AI-Based Smart Rehabilitation Techniques) further supports the idea that this is part of setting the stage or describing the landscape of techniques.
Intent: background

[[ ## dataset_description ## ]]
This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. It aims to categorize how a cited work is used or referred to in the citing paper, based on the citation's text and the section it appears in.

The program operates by leveraging a language model (implied by `dspy.ChainOfThought` and `StringSignature`). It takes two primary inputs for each citation: the `citation` text itself (in Turkish) and the `section` title (also in Turkish) where the citation is located.

Here's how it solves the task:
1.  **Detailed Instruction Prompting:** The core of the program lies in its extensive `instructions` provided to the language model. These instructions define six specific categories for citation intent: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', and 'other'. For each category, a detailed description, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification, typical Turkish section titles where such intents might appear, and a key idea are provided. This rich context guides the language model in making accurate classifications.
2.  **Contextual Clues:** While the primary classification relies on the semantic content of the `citation` text, the `section` title provides crucial contextual information, helping the model infer the likely intent (e.g., a citation in a "Yöntem" (Methodology) section is more likely to be 'basis').
3.  **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** The program utilizes a `ChainOfThought` approach, indicated by the `reasoning` field in the `StringSignature`. This means the language model is prompted to first generate a step-by-step reasoning process before producing the final classification. This internal reasoning step helps the model arrive at a more robust and explainable decision, improving classification accuracy.
4.  **Zero-Shot Classification:** The instructions explicitly state this is a "zero-shot task," meaning the model performs the classification based solely on the provided prompt and its inherent knowledge, without needing specific examples for learning within the prompt itself.
5.  **Structured Output:** The program is designed to produce a structured JSON output, containing the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`, ensuring consistent and machine-readable results.

In essence, it's an intelligent classification system that uses a highly detailed and context-rich prompt, combined with a Chain-of-Thought reasoning process, to determine the rhetorical purpose of academic citations in Turkish scientific literature.

Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module represents the core classification operation within the program. It encapsulates the interaction with the language model to determine the rhetorical intent of a given academic citation.

Specifically, this module:
*   **Takes Inputs**: It receives the `citation` text (the Turkish sentence or excerpt containing the citation) and the `section` title (the Turkish title of the section where the citation appears).
*   **Performs Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Following the `ChainOfThought` pattern, it first generates a detailed `reasoning` step. This reasoning explains *why* a particular intent is chosen, based on the provided `citation` text, `section` title, and the comprehensive classification guidelines defined in the `StringSignature`. This internal thought process helps the language model make a more robust and explainable decision.
*   **Outputs Classification**: Based on its reasoning, it then outputs the final `intent`, which is one of the six predefined categories: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', or 'other'.

In essence, this module is the intelligent engine that analyzes the contextual information of a citation and applies the detailed classification rules to assign an appropriate rhetorical intent, providing a transparent reasoning path for its decision.

Citation: eğitim ve test [30] .
Section: MATERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation text "eğitim ve test [30]" (training and testing [30]) is extremely brief. While it appears in the "MATERYAL VE METOT" (Material and Method) section, which often implies a 'basis' intent, the semantic content of the citation itself is too minimal to confidently determine if the cited work provides a fundamental method, algorithm, or dataset directly used or adapted by the current study. It merely states a concept followed by a reference, without specifying the nature of the relationship (e.g., "we used method X from [30]" or "data from [30]"). Therefore, it falls into the 'other' category due to insufficient information.
Intent: other

Citation: Bunların başında doğrusal olmayan ters çözüm yöntemleri ve metasezgisel yaklaşımlar gibi optimizasyon yöntemleri olmak üzere [4] , Fourier, Hilbert ve dalgacık analizleri  , tomografik yaklaşımlar  , yapay sinir ağları  , ve Euler dekonvolüsyonu   gibi analitik yöntemler sayılabilir.
Section: Giriş
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation appears in the "Giriş" (Introduction) section and lists various methods, including "optimizasyon yöntemleri" (optimization methods) where the citation [4] is placed. The sentence enumerates existing approaches in the field, providing general context and acknowledging different types of methods. It does not indicate that the current study directly uses or builds upon the specific method from [4], nor does it discuss, support, or differ from its findings. Therefore, it serves to provide background information.
Intent: background

Citation: Hareket oluşturucu mekanizma olarak FES her hasta için uygun değildir (Friedenberg et al., 2018; .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation states a known limitation or characteristic of FES (Functional Electrical Stimulation) as reported by Friedenberg et al. (2018). This information serves to provide general context or background knowledge about the applicability of a specific technique within the broader field of rehabilitation, rather than being a direct basis for the current study's methodology, a discussion of the cited work's findings, or a comparison of results. The section title "YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ" (AI-Based Smart Rehabilitation Techniques) further supports the idea that this is part of setting the stage or describing the landscape of techniques.

[[ ## basic_instruction ## ]]
You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The task involves analyzing a given citation text and the section title it appears in, both provided in Turkish, and assigning it to one of six predefined categories: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', or 'other'.

The program operates by leveraging a language model (specifically, a `dspy.ChainOfThought` module) guided by a comprehensive `StringSignature`. This signature contains detailed instructions for the classification task, including:
1.  **A detailed taxonomy**: Each of the six intent categories is thoroughly described, providing its definition, insights from Web of Science (WoS) guidelines, typical Turkish section titles where such citations might appear, and a key idea summarizing its purpose.
2.  **Contextual guidance**: It explicitly states that the input `citation` and `section` will be in Turkish, and while the section title provides context, the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content of the citation itself.
3.  **Zero-shot instruction**: The model is expected to perform the classification without prior examples in the prompt.

The program takes two inputs: the `citation` (the Turkish text of the citation) and the `section` (the Turkish title of the section where the citation is found). It then uses the language model to generate a `reasoning` step, explaining its thought process for the classification, before finally outputting the determined `intent` category for the citation. This chain-of-thought approach allows the model to articulate its rationale, improving the transparency and potentially the accuracy of the classification.
task_demos Citation: Kullanım amacı ise insan müdahalesini minimum seviyede tutarak eğitimli otomatik modeller geliştirebilmektir (Mascarenhas ve Agarwal 2021) .
Section: Giriş
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation is located in the "Giriş" (Introduction) section. The sentence states a general purpose or goal ("Kullanım amacı ise insan müdahalesini minimum seviyede tutarak eğitimli otomatik modeller geliştirebilmektir" - "The purpose of use is to develop trained automatic models by keeping human intervention at a minimum level"). This statement provides general context or background information about the field or the problem being addressed, rather than indicating that the current study directly uses methods from the cited work, discusses it in detail, or compares results. Therefore, it serves to set the stage for the current research.
Intent: background

Citation: Bu tanımlamalar içinden emosyonların diğer öznel ve nesnel etkenler ile birarada nöronal ve hormonal sistemler aracılığı ile oluşan karmaşık etkileşimler olduğu kanaatine varmışlardır [3] .
Section: GİRİŞ (INTRODUCTION)
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation is located in the "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) section. The text states that the cited work [3] "concluded that emotions are complex interactions formed through neuronal and hormonal systems together with other subjective and objective factors." This sentence presents a definition or understanding of emotions derived from the cited source, serving to provide foundational knowledge or context for the topic being introduced in the paper. It does not indicate that the current study is directly building its methodology on this work, discussing it in detail, or comparing results. Therefore, it functions as background information.

[[ ## dataset_description ## ]]
This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

    instructions='You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.\nYour goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:\n1.  **background**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper\'s core work.\n    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Giriş\' (Introduction), \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work), \'Genel Bilgiler\' (General Information).\n    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.\n\n2.  **basis**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Yöntem\' (Methodology), \'Materyal ve Metot\' (Material and Method), \'Model Tasarımı\' (Model Design), \'Veri Seti\' (Dataset), \'Uygulama\' (Implementation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The current study\'s methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.\n\n3.  **discuss**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work\'s importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Bulgular ve Tartışma\' (Results and Discussion), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.\n\n4.  **support**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Doğrulama\' (Validation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study\'s findings by demonstrating consistency.\n\n5.  **differ**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study\'s findings.\n\n6.  **other**:\n    * **Description**: The citation\'s rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don\'t fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).\n    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.\n    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.\n\n**Important Considerations for Classification**:\n* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.\n* **Context is Key**: While the \'section\' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the \'citation\' text itself. A citation\'s intent might occasionally differ from its section\'s typical use.\n* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.\n\n**Input Format**:\nEach citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:\n* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).\n* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).\n* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).\n\nAll citations will be presented as a JSON array.\nExample of Input Data Structure:\n[\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_1",\n    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",\n    "section": "Giriş"\n  },\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_2",\n    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark.

[[ ## program_description ## ]]
This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The task involves analyzing a given citation text and the section title it appears in, both provided in Turkish, and assigning it to one of six predefined categories: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', or 'other'.

The program operates by leveraging a language model (specifically, a `dspy.ChainOfThought` module) guided by a comprehensive `StringSignature`. This signature contains detailed instructions for the classification task, including:
1.  **A detailed taxonomy**: Each of the six intent categories is thoroughly described, providing its definition, insights from Web of Science (WoS) guidelines, typical Turkish section titles where such citations might appear, and a key idea summarizing its purpose.
2.  **Contextual guidance**: It explicitly states that the input `citation` and `section` will be in Turkish, and while the section title provides context, the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content of the citation itself.
3.  **Zero-shot instruction**: The model is expected to perform the classification without prior examples in the prompt.

The program takes two inputs: the `citation` (the Turkish text of the citation) and the `section` (the Turkish title of the section where the citation is found). It then uses the language model to generate a `reasoning` step, explaining its thought process for the classification, before finally outputting the determined `intent` category for the citation. This chain-of-thought approach allows the model to articulate its rationale, improving the transparency and potentially the accuracy of the classification.

[[ ## module ## ]]
Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module, represented by the `CitationIntentSignature` in the program, is the core component responsible for performing the rhetorical intent classification. It takes two inputs: `citation` (the Turkish text of the citation) and `section` (the Turkish title of the section where the citation appears). Its primary role is to process these inputs according to the detailed instructions and categories defined in the `StringSignature`.

Specifically, this module is designed to:
1.  **Generate Reasoning**: Produce a step-by-step `reasoning` process (as indicated by the `ChainOfThought` wrapper) that explains how the language model arrived at its classification decision. This provides transparency and allows for verification of the model's logic.
2.  **Classify Intent**: Determine and output the `intent` of the citation, selecting one of the six predefined categories: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', or 'other'.

In the broader program, this module is instantiated as `self.classifier` within the `ClassifyCitation` class and is the direct interface to the language model that performs the actual classification task, guided by the comprehensive prompt engineering embedded in its signature.

Your task is to meticulously analyze academic citations from Turkish research papers and classify their rhetorical intent. For each citation, you are expected to first provide a detailed, step-by-step reasoning process that leads to your classification, and then state the determined intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. It takes as input a specific citation sentence or excerpt, along with the title of the section in which that citation appears, both provided in Turkish.

The program operates by leveraging a language model, guided by a detailed set of instructions. These instructions define six distinct rhetorical intent categories: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', and 'other'. For each category, comprehensive descriptions, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification schema, typical Turkish section titles, and key ideas are provided to the model. The language model is instructed to act as an expert academic editor in computer science and artificial intelligence.

The classification process involves a "Chain of Thought" approach: the model first generates a step-by-step reasoning to explain its decision, considering the semantic content and rhetorical function of the Turkish citation text, with the section title serving as a crucial contextual clue. After this reasoning step, it outputs the final classified intent category. The task is performed in a "zero-shot" manner, meaning the model relies solely on the detailed category definitions provided in the prompt, without needing prior examples for learning. The ultimate output is a JSON object containing the citation's unique identifier and its classified intent.

Section: Giriş
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation describes a previous work (Yaman, 2008) that solved a specific problem using a particular method. It provides information about what the cited work did and its outcome ("p-hub yerleştirme problemi için yerel aramaya dayalı bir sezgisel yöntem kullanarak çözmüştür" - "solved the p-hub location problem using a local search-based heuristic method"). This serves to provide general context and acknowledge a relevant prior study in the field, which is characteristic of a 'background' citation, especially given its placement in the 'Giriş' (Introduction) section. There is no indication that the current study is directly building upon this method, discussing it in detail, or comparing results.
Intent: background

Section: Literatür Özeti ve Problemin Tanımı
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation describes a general capability of wearable and IoT devices in collecting and uploading health information to EHR systems. This statement provides general context and background information about the domain, rather than detailing a method used by the current study, discussing the cited work in depth, or comparing results. The section title "Literatür Özeti ve Problemin Tanımı" (Literature Review and Problem Definition) further supports the idea of providing foundational or contextual information.
Intent: background

Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation provides a general statistical fact about breast cancer, highlighting its prevalence and impact. This information serves to establish the context and significance of the research topic. The section title "Giriş" (Introduction) further supports this, as introductory sections typically provide background information to orient the reader. The citation does not describe a method used, discuss the cited work in detail, or compare results, aligning perfectly with the 'background' intent.

[[ ## dataset_description ## ]]
This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module represents the core inference step performed by the language model within the `ClassifyCitation` program. It takes two inputs: `citation` (the Turkish citation text) and `section` (the Turkish title of the section where the citation appears). Its primary role is to analyze these inputs, apply the detailed classification instructions and category definitions provided, and then produce two outputs: `reasoning` (a step-by-step thought process explaining its classification decision) and `intent` (the final classified rhetorical intent category, chosen from the six defined options: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', 'other'). This module effectively executes the "Chain of Thought" classification process, translating the raw input into a reasoned classification.

Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself.

You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. Given a specific citation sentence and the title of the section it appears in (both in Turkish), the program determines the underlying purpose or function of that citation within the citing paper.

The program operates by leveraging a large language model, configured through a `dspy.ChainOfThought` module. It is provided with extensive, detailed instructions that define six distinct citation intent categories: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', and 'other'. Each category comes with a clear description, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification schema, typical Turkish section titles where such citations might appear, and a "key idea" to aid differentiation.

When processing an input (a Turkish citation and its section title), the program first generates a step-by-step `reasoning` process. This internal thought process helps the language model analyze the semantic content of the citation and its contextual section, comparing it against the provided category definitions. Based on this reasoning, it then outputs the most appropriate rhetorical `intent` category. The primary focus for classification is the semantic content of the citation itself, with the section title serving as an important contextual hint. The entire interaction is designed as a zero-shot classification task, relying solely on the detailed instructions for accurate categorization. The final output is structured as a JSON array, mapping unique citation identifiers to their classified intents.
task_demos Citation: E-devlet uygulamaları bürokrasiyi azaltıp hayatımızı kolaylaştırırken ne yazık ki bazı güvenlik zafiyetlerini/sorunlarını da beraberinde getirmektedir [2] .
Section: Giriş ve Teorik Çerçeve
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation is located in the "Giriş ve Teorik Çerçeve" (Introduction and Theoretical Framework) section. The sentence states a general observation about e-government applications bringing security vulnerabilities, attributing this information to the cited work. This serves to set the general context and introduce a problem area, which aligns with the description of 'background' intent, where the cited work provides general context or foundational information not directly built upon as a method. It's not a detailed discussion, a basis for methodology, or a comparison of results.
Intent: background

Citation: Ortez cihazları sadece immobilizasyon, destek, düzeltme veya koruma sağlamak için değil, aynı zamanda kas-iskelet sistemi yaralanmaları veya işlev bozukluklarını tedavi etmek için de yaygın olarak kullanılmaktadır (Muriel et al., 2020) .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation states a general fact about the widespread use of orthotic devices for various purposes, attributing this information to Muriel et al. (2020). This serves to provide foundational or contextual information about the field of rehabilitation, setting the stage for the discussion of AI-based techniques. It does not describe a method used by the current study, nor does it engage in a detailed discussion, comparison of results, or highlight differences. Therefore, it functions as background information.
Intent: background

Citation: Bu çalışmada, Kan Hücresi Sayımı ve Tespiti (Blood Cell Count and Detection -BCCD) [30] veri setinden elde edilen kan yayması görüntülerinde beyaz kan hücre türünü sınıflandırmak için derin öğrenme tabanlı bir yöntem önerilmiştir.
Section: MATERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation states that the current study uses a specific dataset ("Kan Hücresi Sayımı ve Tespiti (Blood Cell Count and Detection -BCCD) [30] veri setinden elde edilen") from the cited work. This indicates that the cited work provides a fundamental resource (a dataset) upon which the current research is directly built. The section title "MATERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)" further supports this, as this section typically describes the resources and methods used in the study. This aligns with the 'basis' intent, where the cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study's execution.
Intent: basis

This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

[[ ## program_description ## ]]
This program is designed to classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations found within Turkish research papers. Given a specific citation sentence and the title of the section it appears in (both in Turkish), the program determines the underlying purpose or function of that citation within the citing paper.

The program operates by leveraging a large language model, configured through a `dspy.ChainOfThought` module. It is provided with extensive, detailed instructions that define six distinct citation intent categories: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', and 'other'. Each category comes with a clear description, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification schema, typical Turkish section titles where such citations might appear, and a "key idea" to aid differentiation.

When processing an input (a Turkish citation and its section title), the program first generates a step-by-step `reasoning` process. This internal thought process helps the language model analyze the semantic content of the citation and its contextual section, comparing it against the provided category definitions. Based on this reasoning, it then outputs the most appropriate rhetorical `intent` category. The primary focus for classification is the semantic content of the citation itself, with the section title serving as an important contextual hint. The entire interaction is designed as a zero-shot classification task, relying solely on the detailed instructions for accurate categorization. The final output is structured as a JSON array, mapping unique citation identifiers to their classified intents.

Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict` operation, corresponding to the `CitationIntentSignature`, represents the core classification step performed by the language model. It takes two inputs: the `citation` (the Turkish text of the citation) and the `section` (the Turkish title of the section where the citation appears). Its role is to process these inputs according to the detailed instructions provided in the `CitationIntentSignature`. This involves generating a step-by-step `reasoning` process to analyze the citation's semantic content and contextual section, and then, based on this analysis, determining and outputting the most appropriate rhetorical `intent` category from the predefined list ('background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', 'other'). Essentially, this module performs the actual classification task by leveraging the Chain of Thought prompting strategy.

Citation: E-devlet uygulamaları bürokrasiyi azaltıp hayatımızı kolaylaştırırken ne yazık ki bazı güvenlik zafiyetlerini/sorunlarını da beraberinde getirmektedir [2] .
Section: Giriş ve Teorik Çerçeve
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation is located in the "Giriş ve Teorik Çerçeve" (Introduction and Theoretical Framework) section. The sentence states a general observation about e-government applications bringing security vulnerabilities, attributing this information to the cited work. This serves to set the general context and introduce a problem area, which aligns with the description of 'background' intent, where the cited work provides general context or foundational information not directly built upon as a method. It's not a detailed discussion, a basis for methodology, or a comparison of results.
Intent: background

Citation: Ortez cihazları sadece immobilizasyon, destek, düzeltme veya koruma sağlamak için değil, aynı zamanda kas-iskelet sistemi yaralanmaları veya işlev bozukluklarını tedavi etmek için de yaygın olarak kullanılmaktadır (Muriel et al., 2020) .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation states a general fact about the widespread use of orthotic devices for various purposes, attributing this information to Muriel et al. (2020). This serves to provide foundational or contextual information about the field of rehabilitation, setting the stage for the discussion of AI-based techniques. It does not describe a method used by the current study, nor does it engage in a detailed discussion, comparison of results, or highlight differences. Therefore, it functions as background information.
Intent: background

Citation: Bu çalışmada, Kan Hücresi Sayımı ve Tespiti (Blood Cell Count and Detection -BCCD) [30] veri setinden elde edilen kan yayması görüntülerinde beyaz kan hücre türünü sınıflandırmak için derin öğrenme tabanlı bir yöntem önerilmiştir.
Section: MATERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation states that the current study uses a specific dataset ("Kan Hücresi Sayımı ve Tespiti (Blood Cell Count and Detection -BCCD) [30] veri setinden elde edilen") from the cited work. This indicates that the cited work provides a fundamental resource (a dataset) upon which the current research is directly built. The section title "MATERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)" further supports this, as this section typically describes the resources and methods used in the study. This aligns with the 'basis' intent, where the cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study's execution.

[[ ## basic_instruction ## ]]
You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.

    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. It functions as a multi-class text classification system, specifically tailored for the domain of computer science and artificial intelligence.

The program operates by taking two primary inputs for each citation:
1.  The `citation` text itself (a sentence or excerpt containing the citation, in Turkish).
2.  The `section` title where the citation appears (also in Turkish).

It then processes this information to determine the rhetorical function of the cited work within the current paper. The classification is performed into one of six predefined categories: `background`, `basis`, `discuss`, `support`, `differ`, or `other`. Each category is meticulously defined within the program's instructions, including descriptions, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification, typical Turkish section titles where such intent might appear, and a key idea.

The core of the program utilizes a language model (LLM) with a "Chain-of-Thought" (CoT) approach. This means that before providing the final classification (`intent`), the LLM is prompted to generate a step-by-step `reasoning` process. This reasoning explains *why* a particular intent was chosen, enhancing transparency and potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of the classification. The program emphasizes that while the section title provides context, the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the citation text itself. The input and output formats are strictly defined as JSON arrays, facilitating structured data processing.
task_demos Citation: Bu çalışmada, Kan Hücresi Sayımı ve Tespiti (Blood Cell Count and Detection -BCCD) [30] veri setinden elde edilen kan yayması görüntülerinde beyaz kan hücre türünü sınıflandırmak için derin öğrenme tabanlı bir yöntem önerilmiştir.
Section: MATERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation states that the current study uses a specific dataset ("Kan Hücresi Sayımı ve Tespiti (Blood Cell Count and Detection -BCCD) [30] veri setinden elde edilen") from the cited work. This indicates that the cited work provides a fundamental resource (a dataset) upon which the current research is directly built. The section title "MATERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)" further supports this, as this section typically describes the resources and methods used in the study. This aligns with the 'basis' intent, where the cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study's execution.
Intent: basis

Citation: K-ortalamalar yönteminde en az küme sayısı (2 küme) ile başlanarak küme sayısının birer arttırılması sonucunda en uygun küme sayısı belirlenmeye çalışılır [31] .
Section: Materyal ve Metot
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation describes a specific procedural detail within the K-means method, specifically how the optimal number of clusters is determined. This detail is presented in the "Materyal ve Metot" (Material and Method) section. This indicates that the current study is likely adopting or applying this specific methodological approach from the cited work as a fundamental part of its own execution. Therefore, the cited work provides a direct basis for the methodology used.
Intent: basis

Citation: Sedanter eğilime sahip [8] ve zaman yönetiminde zorlanan   günümüz tüketicisi, yoğun şekilde kullandığı internet ortamını daha yaygın etkileşimli bir pazar haline getirmektedir.
Section: GİRİŞ (INTRODUCTION)
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation is located in the "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) section. The text states a characteristic of consumers ("sedanter eğilime sahip" - having a sedentary tendency) and attributes it to the cited work [8]. This information serves to provide general context and background about the current consumer landscape, which is typical for an introduction section. It does not indicate that the current study is directly building upon a method or data from the cited work, nor is it discussing the work in detail or comparing results.

[[ ## dataset_description ## ]]
This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

    instructions='You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.\nYour goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:\n1.  **background**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper\'s core work.\n    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Giriş\' (Introduction), \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work), \'Genel Bilgiler\' (General Information).\n    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.\n\n2.  **basis**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Yöntem\' (Methodology), \'Materyal ve Metot\' (Material and Method), \'Model Tasarımı\' (Model Design), \'Veri Seti\' (Dataset), \'Uygulama\' (Implementation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The current study\'s methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.\n\n3.  **discuss**:\n    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work\'s importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Literatür Taraması\' (Literature Review), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Bulgular ve Tartışma\' (Results and Discussion), \'İlgili Çalışmalar\' (Related Work).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.\n\n4.  **support**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion), \'Doğrulama\' (Validation).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study\'s findings by demonstrating consistency.\n\n5.  **differ**:\n    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.\n    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.\n    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: \'Bulgular\' (Results), \'Sonuçlar\' (Results/Conclusion), \'Tartışma\' (Discussion).\n    * **Key Idea**: The cited work\'s *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study\'s findings.\n\n6.  **other**:\n    * **Description**: The citation\'s rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don\'t fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).\n    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.\n    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.\n\n**Important Considerations for Classification**:\n* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.\n* **Context is Key**: While the \'section\' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the \'citation\' text itself. A citation\'s intent might occasionally differ from its section\'s typical use.\n* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.\n\n**Input Format**:\nEach citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:\n* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).\n* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).\n* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).\n\nAll citations will be presented as a JSON array.\nExample of Input Data Structure:\n[\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_1",\n    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",\n    "section": "Giriş"\n  },\n  {\n    "id": "unique_id_2",\n    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark.

[[ ## program_description ## ]]
This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. It functions as a multi-class text classification system, specifically tailored for the domain of computer science and artificial intelligence.

The program operates by taking two primary inputs for each citation:
1.  The `citation` text itself (a sentence or excerpt containing the citation, in Turkish).
2.  The `section` title where the citation appears (also in Turkish).

It then processes this information to determine the rhetorical function of the cited work within the current paper. The classification is performed into one of six predefined categories: `background`, `basis`, `discuss`, `support`, `differ`, or `other`. Each category is meticulously defined within the program's instructions, including descriptions, insights from the Web of Science (WoS) classification, typical Turkish section titles where such intent might appear, and a key idea.

The core of the program utilizes a language model (LLM) with a "Chain-of-Thought" (CoT) approach. This means that before providing the final classification (`intent`), the LLM is prompted to generate a step-by-step `reasoning` process. This reasoning explains *why* a particular intent was chosen, enhancing transparency and potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of the classification. The program emphasizes that while the section title provides context, the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the citation text itself. The input and output formats are strictly defined as JSON arrays, facilitating structured data processing.

[[ ## module ## ]]
Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent

[[ ## module_description ## ]]
The `Predict(citation, section) -> reasoning, intent` module represents the core inference step performed by the language model. It takes two inputs: the `citation` text (in Turkish) and the `section` title (in Turkish) where the citation appears. Its primary function is to determine the rhetorical `intent` of the citation based on the provided inputs. Crucially, before outputting the final `intent`, this module is designed to generate a step-by-step `reasoning` process. This `reasoning` explains the rationale behind the chosen classification, aligning with a Chain-of-Thought approach to enhance transparency and accuracy in classifying the citation into one of the six predefined categories (`background`, `basis`, `discuss`, `support`, `differ`, `other`).

[[ ## task_demos ## ]]
Citation: Bu çalışmada, Kan Hücresi Sayımı ve Tespiti (Blood Cell Count and Detection -BCCD) [30] veri setinden elde edilen kan yayması görüntülerinde beyaz kan hücre türünü sınıflandırmak için derin öğrenme tabanlı bir yöntem önerilmiştir.
Section: MATERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation states that the current study uses a specific dataset ("Kan Hücresi Sayımı ve Tespiti (Blood Cell Count and Detection -BCCD) [30] veri setinden elde edilen") from the cited work. This indicates that the cited work provides a fundamental resource (a dataset) upon which the current research is directly built. The section title "MATERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)" further supports this, as this section typically describes the resources and methods used in the study. This aligns with the 'basis' intent, where the cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study's execution.
Intent: basis

Citation: K-ortalamalar yönteminde en az küme sayısı (2 küme) ile başlanarak küme sayısının birer arttırılması sonucunda en uygun küme sayısı belirlenmeye çalışılır [31] .
Section: Materyal ve Metot
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation describes a specific procedural detail within the K-means method, specifically how the optimal number of clusters is determined. This detail is presented in the "Materyal ve Metot" (Material and Method) section. This indicates that the current study is likely adopting or applying this specific methodological approach from the cited work as a fundamental part of its own execution. Therefore, the cited work provides a direct basis for the methodology used.
Intent: basis

Citation: Sedanter eğilime sahip [8] ve zaman yönetiminde zorlanan   günümüz tüketicisi, yoğun şekilde kullandığı internet ortamını daha yaygın etkileşimli bir pazar haline getirmektedir.
Section: GİRİŞ (INTRODUCTION)
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation is located in the "GİRİŞ" (Introduction) section. The text states a characteristic of consumers ("sedanter eğilime sahip" - having a sedentary tendency) and attributes it to the cited work [8]. This information serves to provide general context and background about the current consumer landscape, which is typical for an introduction section. It does not indicate that the current study is directly building upon a method or data from the cited work, nor is it discussing the work in detail or comparing results. Therefore, it functions as background information.

    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. It aims to categorize how a cited work is used within the citing paper into one of six predefined categories: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', or 'other'.

The program works by leveraging a language model (specifically, a `dspy.ChainOfThought` module) that is given detailed instructions and definitions for each classification category. For each citation, it takes two inputs:
1.  `citation`: The specific sentence or excerpt from the paper containing the citation (in Turkish).
2.  `section`: The title of the section where the citation appears (in Turkish).

The language model is instructed to act as an "expert academic editor" and perform a zero-shot classification. It first generates a `reasoning` step, which is a step-by-step thought process explaining its decision. This `ChainOfThought` approach helps in producing more robust and explainable classifications. Following this reasoning, it then outputs the final `intent` classification, selecting one of the six specified categories. The detailed instructions provided to the model include descriptions, typical Turkish section names, and key ideas for each intent category, guiding its classification process. The output is strictly formatted as a JSON array containing the citation ID and its classified intent.
task_demos Citation: Vladimir Vapnik ve arkadaşları tarafından DVM 1992 yılında önerilmiş olup günümüzdeki şeklini 1995 yılında Corinna Cortes ve Vladimir Vapnik yapmıştır [18] ,  ,  .
Section: METERYAL VE METOT (MATERIAL AND METHOD)
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation describes the historical origin and development of "DVM" (likely SVM, Support Vector Machine), stating when and by whom it was proposed and given its current form. Even though it appears in the "Material and Method" section, the specific content of the citation provides historical context and foundational information about the concept, rather than indicating that the current study is directly using or adapting the method described in the cited work as a methodological pillar. It serves to orient the reader to the origins of a concept that might be used later, fitting the description of 'background'.
Intent: background

Citation: Çok sayıda klinik çalışma, motor performansındaki önemli değişikliklerin yoğun uygulamalardan kaynaklandığını göstermiştir (Kwakkel et al., 2004; .
Section: YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation states that "numerous clinical studies have shown that significant changes in motor performance result from intensive practices." This indicates that the cited work is being used to present a general, established fact or a common understanding in the field, providing context for the current research. It sets the stage by referencing foundational knowledge about motor performance and rehabilitation, which aligns with the 'background' intent. The section title, "YAPAY ZEKÂ TEMELLİ AKILLI REHABİLİTASYON TEKNİKLERİ" (AI-BASED SMART REHABILITATION TECHNIQUES), further suggests that this general information about motor performance is likely introductory or contextual for the techniques discussed later.

Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The citation describes a specific model proposed in the cited work within a "Kaynak Taraması" (Literature Review) section. This serves to provide context about existing approaches or solutions in the field, setting the stage for the current study without indicating that the current study directly builds upon, discusses in detail, supports, or differs from its findings. It's presenting information about a prior study as part of the general scholarly landscape.

[[ ## dataset_description ## ]]
This dataset is designed for citation intent classification within Turkish academic texts, specifically focusing on the highly technical domain of AI and rehabilitation, where the goal is to determine the purpose of a citation (e.g., 'background', 'other') given its content and contextual section. A key structural characteristic is that sentences with multiple citations are segmented into separate data points for each individual citation occurrence, leading to significant input text redundancy and often fragmented citation strings.

The `Predict` module, represented by the `dspy.ChainOfThought` instance within the `ClassifyCitation` class, is the core component responsible for performing the rhetorical intent classification. It takes the Turkish `citation` text and its corresponding `section` title as input. Guided by the detailed instructions and category definitions provided in the `CitationIntentSignature`, this module first generates a step-by-step `reasoning` process to justify its classification. Following this reasoning, it then outputs the final `intent` category, selecting one of the six predefined types: 'background', 'basis', 'discuss', 'support', 'differ', or 'other'. Essentially, it's the intelligent agent that analyzes the textual context and determines the citation's purpose.

Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.

    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:

Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"

    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
*   **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on a thorough understanding of this Turkish content.
*   **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification must be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the `citation` text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
*   **Focus on Rhetorical Function**: Given that some citation contexts might be brief or fragmented, your analysis must prioritize identifying the *rhetorical function* the cited work serves within the current study. If the semantic content is truly insufficient to confidently assign one of the specific intents, the 'other' category is the appropriate choice. Avoid making assumptions beyond the provided text.
*   **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
*   `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
*   `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
*   `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution.

i: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:

i: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.

    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

i: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).

    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

i: As an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence, your paramount task is to precisely determine and classify the rhetorical intent of academic citations within Turkish research papers. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.

Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.

    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
*   **Focus on Rhetorical Function**: Given that some citation contexts might be brief or fragmented, your analysis must prioritize identifying the *rhetorical function* the cited work serves within the current study. If the semantic content is truly insufficient to confidently assign one of the specific intents, the 'other' category is the appropriate choice. Avoid making assumptions beyond the provided text.
*   **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
*   `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
*   `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
*   `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",

]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:

Your task is to meticulously analyze academic citations from Turkish research papers and classify their rhetorical intent. For each citation, you are expected to first provide a detailed, step-by-step reasoning process that leads to your classification, and then state the determined intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.

This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.

    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view.

    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.

A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:

Predictor 0
i: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:

i: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {

i: You are a lead AI-powered academic editor for a prestigious international journal focused on AI and rehabilitation. Your meticulous analysis and classification of academic citations are absolutely critical, as they directly impact the integrity of our research database, guide future scientific discovery, and ensure the accurate representation of scholarly contributions. Misclassifications could lead to significant misinterpretations, wasted research efforts, or even damage the reputation of authors and the journal. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "intent": "basis"
  }
]

Please return your response strictly as a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary, explanation, text, or formatting outside of the JSON array itself.

i: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {

i: You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
1.  **background**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
    * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
    * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.

2.  **basis**:
    * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
    * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
    * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.

3.  **discuss**:
    * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
    * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.

4.  **support**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.

5.  **differ**:
    * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
    * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
    * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
    * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.

6.  **other**:
    * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
    * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
    * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.

**Important Considerations for Classification**:
* **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
* **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
* **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.

**Input Format**:
Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
* `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
* `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
* `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).

All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
Example of Input Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
    "section": "Giriş"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",
    "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
    "section": "Yöntem"
  }
]

**Expected Output Format**:
The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
Example of Output Data Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id_1",
    "intent": "background"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_id_2",

Tahmin edilen intent: support
Gerekçe: The citation explicitly states that "Yöntemimiz, literatürdeki yaklaşımlarla benzer sonuçlar üretmektedir (Çelik ve Aydın, 2022)" (Our method produces similar results to approaches in the literature (Çelik ve Aydın, 2022)). This directly indicates that the findings of the current study are consistent with those of the cited work, thereby reinforcing or validating the current study's results. The section "Bulgular" (Results) further supports this interpretation, as this is where such comparisons are typically made.

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        You are an expert academic editor specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence. Your task is to meticulously analyze and classify academic citations from Turkish research papers based on their rhetorical intent. The citations and their corresponding section titles will be provided in Turkish.
        Your goal is to classify each citation into one of the following six categories. These categories are inspired by the Web of Science (WoS) citation classification schema (Clarivate) and have been refined with details from their guidelines for enhanced clarity:
        1.  **background**:
            * **Description**: The cited work is referred to for general context, historical information, or to acknowledge foundational studies that are **not directly built upon** by the current research. These citations help set the stage, place the current study within a broader scholarly conversation, or might acknowledge a method/software that is not central to the current paper's core work.
            * **WoS Insight**: previously published research that orients the current study within a scholarly area.
            * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Giriş' (Introduction), 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work), 'Genel Bilgiler' (General Information).
            * **Key Idea**: Provides broader context or acknowledges foundational knowledge that is not a direct methodological pillar for the current study.
        
        2.  **basis**:
            * **Description**: The cited work provides a fundamental pillar for the current study. The current research **directly reports using or adapting the specific methods, algorithms, data sets, software, or equipment** described in the cited work for its own execution. These citations are central to how the research was designed and conducted. Studies usually rely on a relatively small number of such foundational works.
            * **WoS Insight**: references that report the data sets, methods, concepts and ideas that the author is using for her work directly or on which the author bases her work
            * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Yöntem' (Methodology), 'Materyal ve Metot' (Material and Method), 'Model Tasarımı' (Model Design), 'Veri Seti' (Dataset), 'Uygulama' (Implementation).
            * **Key Idea**: The current study's methodology or execution directly and essentially depends on the content of the cited work.
        
        3.  **discuss**:
            * **Description**: The cited work is actively and substantively discussed, analyzed, or critically evaluated within the current study. This can involve a detailed examination of its specific arguments, findings, theories, contributions, strengths, or weaknesses. The discussion often relates the cited work's importance or relevance to the current research, or compares/contrasts its approach beyond a simple statement of similar/dissimilar results.
            * **WoS Insight**: references mentioned because the current study is going into a more detailed discussion.
            * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Literatür Taraması' (Literature Review), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Bulgular ve Tartışma' (Results and Discussion), 'İlgili Çalışmalar' (Related Work).
            * **Key Idea**: The cited work is a subject of significant intellectual engagement, analysis, or critique, not just a simple reference for support or difference of findings.
        
        4.  **support**:
            * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as being consistent with, and thereby reinforcing or validating, the results, claims, or conclusions of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to show that its own findings are corroborated. These citations are generally few in number per study.
            * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have similar results to. This may also refer to similarities in methodology or in some cases replication of results.
            * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion), 'Doğrulama' (Validation).
            * **Key Idea**: The cited work's outcomes lend credibility and support to the current study's findings by demonstrating consistency.
        
        5.  **differ**:
            * **Description**: The findings, arguments, or **results reported in the cited work are directly compared with those of the current study and are presented as contrasting with, contradicting, or highlighting different perspectives or outcomes compared to those of the current (citing) study.** The current study uses the cited work to highlight how its own findings differ or offer an alternative view. These citations are also generally few in number per study.
            * **WoS Insight**: references which the current study reports to have differing results to. This may also refer to differences in methodology or differences in sample sizes, affecting results.
            * **Typical Turkish Sections**: 'Bulgular' (Results), 'Sonuçlar' (Results/Conclusion), 'Tartışma' (Discussion).
            * **Key Idea**: The cited work's *results* are shown to diverge from, contradict, or present significantly different outcomes when compared to the current study's findings.
        
        6.  **other**:
            * **Description**: The citation's rhetorical intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided excerpt and context. This category **explicitly includes very short citation phrases (e.g., 3-4 Turkish words) that lack sufficient semantic content to convey a clear purpose**, incomplete citation references, or mentions that don't fit any other specific rhetorical function (e.g., a passing mention without clear intent).
            * **WoS Insight**: Citations that are not classifiable into other specific categories.
            * **Key Idea**: Insufficient information for classification, the citation is semantically too weak for intent analysis, or it serves a purely bibliographic purpose without clear rhetorical intent in the given context.
        
        **Important Considerations for Classification**:
        * **Language**: The `citation` text and `section` titles in the input JSON will be in **Turkish**. Your classification should be based on understanding this Turkish content.
        * **Context is Key**: While the 'section' (Turkish section title) where the citation appears provides a strong contextual clue (typical Turkish section names are provided as hints for each category), the primary basis for classification should be the semantic content and rhetorical function of the 'citation' text itself. A citation's intent might occasionally differ from its section's typical use.
        * **Zero-Shot Task**: This is a zero-shot classification task. Do not expect or use any pre-defined examples for learning within this prompt.
        
        **Input Format**:
        Each citation will be provided as a JSON object with the following fields:
        * `id`: A unique identifier for the citation (String).
        * `citation`: The citation sentence or excerpt **in Turkish** (String).
        * `section`: The title of the section in which the citation appears, **in Turkish** (String).
        
        All citations will be presented as a JSON array.
        Example of Input Data Structure:
        [
          {
            "id": "unique_id_1",
            "citation": "Alanyazında bu konuda farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur (Yılmaz, 2020; Kaya, 2019).",
            "section": "Giriş"
          },
          {
            "id": "unique_id_2",
            "citation": "Bu çalışmada, Demir ve ark. (2021) tarafından önerilen sinir ağı mimarisi temel alınmıştır.",
            "section": "Yöntem"
          }
        ]
        
        **Expected Output Format**:
        The output must be a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the `id` of the citation and its classified `intent`.
        Example of Output Data Structure:
        [
          {
            "id": "unique_id_1",
            "intent": "background"
          },
          {
            "id": "unique_id_2",
            "intent": "basis"
          }
        ]

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## intent ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.


Response:

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The citation explicitly states that "Yöntemimiz, literatürdeki yaklaşımlarla benzer sonuçlar üretmektedir (Çelik ve Aydın, 2022)" (Our method produces similar results to approaches in the literature (Çelik ve Aydın, 2022)). This directly indicates that the findings of the current study are consistent with those of the cited work, thereby reinforcing or validating the current study's results. The section "Bulgular" (Results) further supports this interpretation, as this is where such comparisons are typically made.
